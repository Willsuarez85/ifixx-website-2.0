## Executive Summary

This strategy positions Ifixx as Charlotte's trusted remodeling and repair team, differentiating through:

1. **Same-day service** (not 24/7, but fast response)
2. **Direct owner service** (Jaime or Hamed answer, not a call center)
3. **Two customer segments** with distinct value propositions
4. **Full scope**: from daily repairs to complete remodels

## Core Positioning Statement

### The Big Idea

### Positioning Statement

For Charlotte homeowners who need fast repairs or quality remodeling, and for property managers who require a reliable maintenance partner, **Ifixx is the local, family-owned team that delivers professional work, honest pricing, and same-day service**. Unlike franchises with call centers or unreliable contractors, at Ifixx you talk directly to Jaime or Hamed — the owners who stand behind every job.
