## 1. Content Architecture Map

The website architecture will be structured around a "pillar and cluster" model to establish topical authority and improve user navigation. The proposed structure is as follows:

### Pillar Pages

Pillar pages are the foundation of the site's authority. They cover broad topics and act as a hub, linking out to more specific service pages.

- **/repairs/**: "Home Repairs" Pillar. Covers all daily repair services.
- **/remodeling/**: "Home Remodeling" Pillar. Covers all remodeling services.
- **/emergency-services/**: "Emergency Services" Pillar. Covers all urgent and rapid-response services.

### Service Pages (Money Pages)

Each service page focuses on a specific job category with high conversion potential. These pages will be linked from their corresponding pillar pages.

**From the Repairs Pillar:**
- /repairs/plumbing/
- /repairs/electrical/
- /repairs/drywall-painting/
- /repairs/doors-windows/
- /repairs/furniture-assembly/
- /repairs/tv-mounting/

**From the Remodeling Pillar:**
- /remodeling/kitchens/
- /remodeling/bathrooms/
- /remodeling/basements/
- /remodeling/outdoor-living/
- /remodeling/flooring-installation/

**From the Emergency Services Pillar:**
- /emergency-services/24-7-urgent-repairs/

### Location Pages

These pages are crucial for local SEO. They will target specific geographic areas within Charlotte to capture local search intent. Each location page must have unique, locally relevant content.

- /service-areas/charlotte/
- /service-areas/ballantyne/
- /service-areas/matthews/
- /service-areas/waxhaw/
- /service-areas/mint-hill/
- /service-areas/pineville/

### Customer Segment Pages

These pages target IFIXX's two key customer segments with specific messaging and value propositions.

- /for-homeowners/ (B2C)
- /for-property-managers/ (B2B)

### Supporting Pages

These pages build trust and authority and provide essential company information.

- /about-us/ (The story of Jaime and Hamed)
- /our-work/ (Project gallery / Before & After)
- /contact/
- /blog/ (Optional, for future content initiatives)

## 2. Page Intent Table

The following table defines the main purpose of each page type, the search intent it satisfies, and its conversion goal.

| Page Type | Primary Search Intent | Purpose and Conversion Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Pillar Pages** | **Informational / Commercial** | To educate the user about the breadth of IFIXX's services. The goal is to channel the user to a specific service page. |
| **Service Pages** | **Commercial** | Targeted at users ready to hire. The goal is to generate a call or form submission. Must include social proof, photos, and a clear call to action. |
| **Location Pages** | **Local** | To capture users searching for services "near me" or in a specific area. The goal is to demonstrate local relevance and generate a contact. |
| **Segment Pages** | **Commercial (Specific)** | To speak directly to the needs of a customer type (homeowner vs. property manager). The goal is to present a tailored offer and generate a contact. |
| **Supporting Pages** | **Informational / Trust** | To build trust and credibility. The "About Us" page should tell the story of Jaime and Hamed. The "Our Work" gallery is crucial for social proof. |

## 5. Internal Linking Strategy Summary

Internal linking is fundamental to distributing authority across the site, helping Google understand the relationship between pages, and guiding users toward conversion. The logic will be as follows:

### From Pillars to Services

-   **Purpose:** To transfer authority from pillar pages (broad topics) to service pages (specific, high-conversion topics).
-   **Logic:** Each pillar page (e.g., `/remodeling/`) should contain sections that introduce each of its associated services (e.g., "Kitchen Remodeling," "Bathroom Remodeling"). Each of these introductions must link directly to the corresponding service page (e.g., `/remodeling/kitchens/`).
-   **Anchor Text:** Should be descriptive and keyword-rich, such as "See our kitchen remodeling projects" or "Learn more about our bathroom remodeling services."

### From Services to Locations

-   **Purpose:** To connect the commercial intent of a service with geographic relevance.
-   **Logic:** Each service page (e.g., `/repairs/plumbing/`) should mention the key service areas and link to the most relevant location pages. For example, a section titled "Trusted Plumbing Service in Charlotte and Surrounding Areas" can link to `/service-areas/charlotte/` and `/service-areas/ballantyne/`.
-   **Anchor Text:** Should combine the service and location, such as "plumbing service in Charlotte" or "plumbing repairs in Ballantyne."

### From Locations to Reinforce Authority

-   **Purpose:** To demonstrate to Google and users that IFIXX is a relevant local player with authority in multiple service areas.
-   **Logic:** Each location page (e.g., `/service-areas/matthews/`) should not only discuss the location but also summarize the key services offered in that area, linking back to the most important service pages. For example: "We offer a full range of services in Matthews, including kitchen remodeling and emergency repairs."
-   **Cross-Linking:** Location pages can also link to each other naturally to show the breadth of coverage in the Charlotte area (e.g., from the Matthews page, link to the Pineville page if they are adjacent areas).

### Navigation and Footer Links

-   **Main Navigation:** Should include links to the pillar pages (`Repairs`, `Remodeling`, `Emergency Services`), segment pages (`For Homeowners`, `For Property Managers`), and supporting pages (`About Us`, `Our Work`, `Contact`).
-   **Footer:** Should include links to the main service pages and the top 5-6 most important location pages to ensure they are easily crawled by Google.
