  description: "A Harrisburg family had just moved in and had a list of small issues: squeaky bedroom doors, loose towel bars in two bathrooms, a crooked curtain rod, missing door stops, and several pictures to hang. We knocked out the entire list in about 3 hours. Fifteen small fixes that would have taken them several frustrating weekends—done in one efficient visit."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What counts as a quick fix?"
    a: "Quick fixes include things like: hanging pictures and mirrors, mounting shelves, fixing squeaky doors, adjusting cabinet doors, tightening loose handles, installing door stops, caulking gaps, weather stripping doors, replacing batteries in smoke detectors, and dozens of other small jobs."
  - q: "How much do small handyman jobs cost in Concord?"
    a: "Most quick fixes cost $75-$150. For multiple small jobs, we offer hourly rates ($75-$95/hour) which often makes more sense. We can give you an estimate over the phone for most small jobs."
  - q: "Is there a minimum charge?"
    a: "Our minimum service call is $75, which includes up to 30-45 minutes of work. Most quick fixes fall within this minimum. For larger jobs or multiple items, we quote by the job or hourly."
  - q: "Can you do a bunch of small jobs in one visit?"
    a: "Absolutely—this is our specialty. Bring us your honey-do list and we'll work through it efficiently. Hourly rates make this economical. Many customers save their small tasks and schedule us quarterly."
  - q: "How do I schedule a quick fix?"
    a: "Call or text us at (980) 391-6833. Tell us what you need done and we'll schedule a time—often same-day or next-day. For small jobs, phone estimates are usually accurate."
  - q: "Can you help me hang a TV?"
    a: "TV mounting is one of our most popular services—we have a dedicated service page for it. But yes, it starts as a quick call and we often complete it same-day."
  - q: "Do you help with moving-related tasks?"
    a: "Yes, we help new Concord residents frequently: hanging pictures, mounting TVs, assembling furniture, adjusting doors that don't close right in the new house, and other move-in tasks. We can often knock out your whole list in one visit."
  - q: "What if I don't know how to fix something?"
    a: "That's exactly why we're here. Describe the problem and we'll figure out the solution. Sometimes what seems like a mystery is a 5-minute fix. Sometimes it's bigger—we'll tell you honestly either way."

localInfo:
  permits: "Quick fixes don't require permits. If a small repair reveals a larger issue that needs permits (rare), we'll let you know."
  regulations: "We follow best practices for all work, even small jobs. Properly anchored shelves, correctly installed hardware, and attention to detail."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior quick fixes don't require HOA notification. Exterior items (like house numbers or mailbox posts) may have HOA specifications in some Concord communities."
