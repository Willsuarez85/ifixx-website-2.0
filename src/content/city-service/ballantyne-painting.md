  title: "Whole-House Interior Repaint in Providence Plantation"
  neighborhood: "Providence Plantation"
  description: "This Providence Plantation homeowner wanted to update their home's dated interior colors before putting it on the market. We repainted the entire 4,200 sq ft home—walls, ceilings, trim, and doors—in a modern neutral palette that would appeal to buyers. We worked room by room to minimize disruption, protected all flooring and fixtures, and completed the project in 8 days. The home sold within two weeks of listing, and the agent credited the fresh paint as a key factor in the quick sale."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Do Ballantyne HOAs have rules about exterior paint colors?"
    a: "Yes, most Ballantyne communities have approved color palettes for exterior painting. We're familiar with the requirements in communities like Ballantyne Country Club, Piper Glen, Providence Plantation, and Blakeney. We can help you select colors that meet HOA guidelines while achieving your vision. Always get HOA approval before starting exterior work."
  - q: "What paint quality do you use in Ballantyne homes?"
    a: "We use premium paints appropriate for each application. For interiors, we typically use Sherwin-Williams Cashmere or Duration, or Benjamin Moore Regal Select—paints with excellent coverage, durability, and washability. For exteriors, we use premium acrylic latex with excellent adhesion and UV resistance. We're happy to discuss specific product recommendations."
  - q: "How do you protect my Ballantyne home during interior painting?"
    a: "Protection is critical in Ballantyne homes with premium finishes. We cover all floors with canvas drop cloths, protect furniture and fixtures with plastic, use painter's tape on all edges, and clean up thoroughly at the end of each day. We treat your home with the care it deserves."
  - q: "Can you match the existing trim color in my Ballantyne home?"
    a: "Yes, we can match virtually any existing color using spectrophotometer technology. This is especially important in Ballantyne homes where you may want to repaint one room while matching existing trim throughout the house. We bring samples to verify the match before starting."

localInfo:
  permits: "Painting typically doesn't require permits in Mecklenburg County unless it's part of a larger renovation project. However, exterior painting in Ballantyne communities typically requires HOA architectural approval."
  regulations: "For homes built before 1978, we follow EPA lead paint regulations including testing and proper containment. Most Ballantyne homes are newer and don't have this concern, but we verify before starting any project."
  hoaConsiderations: "Ballantyne HOAs typically require architectural approval for exterior color changes. The approval process usually takes 2-4 weeks. We recommend starting this process early and can help you prepare your submission with color samples and descriptions."
