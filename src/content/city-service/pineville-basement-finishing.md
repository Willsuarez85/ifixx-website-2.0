  neighborhood: "McMullen Creek"
  description: "A Pineville family wanted to transform their unused basement into a multi-purpose space. We framed and insulated the walls, installed recessed lighting, added a half bathroom, created a dedicated home theater area with a wet bar, and finished with luxury vinyl plank flooring throughout. The project included a separate home office space with built-in shelving. The finished basement added over 1,000 square feet of living space."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does it cost to finish a basement in Pineville?"
    a: "Basement finishing in Pineville typically runs $30-$50 per square foot for basic finishing (framing, drywall, flooring, lighting) and $50-$75+ per square foot for more complex projects including bathrooms, wet bars, or high-end finishes. A 1,000 sq ft basement typically costs $35,000-$65,000. We provide detailed quotes based on your specific project."
  - q: "How long does basement finishing take in Pineville?"
    a: "A typical basement finishing project takes 6-12 weeks depending on scope. Basic finishing (no bathroom) takes 6-8 weeks. Adding a bathroom extends the timeline to 8-12 weeks due to rough-in work and inspections. We provide a detailed schedule before starting."
  - q: "Do I need permits to finish my Pineville basement?"
    a: "Yes, basement finishing in Mecklenburg County requires permits for framing, electrical, and bathroom rough-in. We handle all permit applications, inspections, and approvals as part of our service."
  - q: "What about moisture and water issues?"
    a: "Moisture control is critical for basement finishing. We assess moisture levels before starting and recommend solutions like interior drainage, dehumidification, or waterproofing as needed. We won't finish over moisture problems—that leads to mold and damage."
  - q: "Can you add a bathroom to my basement?"
    a: "Yes, basement bathrooms are one of our specialties. If your home has a rough-in (many newer Pineville homes do), the process is straightforward. Without a rough-in, we can add one, though costs are higher due to concrete cutting and fixture installation."
  - q: "What flooring works best in a Pineville basement?"
    a: "We recommend luxury vinyl plank (LVP) for most Pineville basements. It's waterproof, comfortable, and handles temperature fluctuations well. Carpet tiles are good for dedicated family room areas. We avoid hardwood due to moisture concerns."

localInfo:
  permits: "Basement finishing in Pineville requires Mecklenburg County permits for framing, electrical, and any fixture installations. We handle all permitting and inspections as part of our service."
  regulations: "Pineville follows NC State Building Code. Basement bedrooms require egress windows. Ceiling height, electrical, and ventilation must meet code requirements. We ensure full compliance."
  hoaConsiderations: "Basement finishing is interior work and typically doesn't require HOA approval. Some HOAs may have restrictions on basement apartments or rental use."
