localIntro: "Charlotte bathrooms range from original 1920s tile work in Dilworth to spa-like retreats in new Ballantyne construction. After remodeling 200+ bathrooms across the Queen City, we've mastered everything from small powder room updates to full master bath transformations. Our team knows Charlotte homes inside and out—from the plumbing quirks of Plaza Midwood to the HOA requirements of South Charlotte communities."

  title: "Dilworth Master Bath Renovation"
  neighborhood: "Dilworth"
  description: "This 1928 Dilworth bungalow had its original bathroom—complete with a clawfoot tub and hexagonal floor tile. The homeowners wanted modern convenience while preserving the home's character. We kept the clawfoot tub (refinished), added a frameless glass walk-in shower, installed heated floors, and replaced the old pedestal sink with a custom vanity that matches the home's Craftsman style. The original hex tile was beyond saving, but we found a period-appropriate replacement that passes inspection by even the pickiest Dilworth neighbors."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Do I need a permit for bathroom remodeling in Charlotte?"
    a: "In Mecklenburg County, permits are required when you're moving plumbing fixtures, adding electrical circuits, or making structural changes. A simple vanity swap or tile replacement typically doesn't require a permit. For full bathroom remodels, we handle all permit applications and inspections as part of our service."
  - q: "Can you work with the older plumbing in Charlotte's historic homes?"
    a: "Yes—this is one of our specialties. We've worked extensively in Dilworth, Myers Park, Plaza Midwood, and Elizabeth where homes often have original galvanized pipes and cast iron drains. We know how to tie into existing systems properly and when full replacement makes more sense. Our team takes extra care to protect original features while bringing bathrooms up to modern standards."
  - q: "How long does a typical Charlotte bathroom remodel take?"
    a: "A full bathroom renovation in Charlotte typically takes 2-4 weeks, depending on scope. Factors that affect timeline include custom vanity lead times (usually 3-4 weeks), tile availability, and permit inspection scheduling. We provide a detailed timeline before starting and keep you updated throughout the project."
  - q: "Do you handle bathroom remodeling in Charlotte condos?"
    a: "Yes, we work with condo owners throughout Charlotte, including SouthPark, Uptown, and South End high-rises. We're familiar with HOA requirements, building management coordination, and the specific challenges of condo bathroom renovations like waterproofing, noise restrictions, and shared plumbing stacks."

localInfo:
  permits: "Mecklenburg County requires permits for plumbing relocation, electrical work, and structural changes. Typical permit approval takes 5-10 business days. Inspections are scheduled through the county online portal."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows NC Residential Building Code. GFCI outlets required near water sources. Proper ventilation (exhaust fan) required for all bathrooms. Shower pan liner inspections required before tile installation."
  hoaConsiderations: "Many Charlotte condos and HOAs require written approval before bathroom renovations, especially work involving plumbing or waterproofing. We help coordinate with your HOA or building management as part of our service."
