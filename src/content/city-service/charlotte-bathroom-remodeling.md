localIntro: "Charlotte bathrooms range from original 1920s tile work in Dilworth to spa-like retreats in new Ballantyne construction. After remodeling 200+ bathrooms across the Queen City, we've mastered everything from small powder room updates to full master bath transformations. Our team knows Charlotte homes inside and out—from the plumbing quirks of Plaza Midwood to the HOA requirements of South Charlotte communities."

  title: "Dilworth Master Bath Renovation"
  neighborhood: "Dilworth"
  description: "This 1928 Dilworth bungalow had its original bathroom—complete with a clawfoot tub and hexagonal floor tile. The homeowners wanted modern convenience while preserving the home's character. We kept the clawfoot tub (refinished), added a frameless glass walk-in shower, installed heated floors, and replaced the old pedestal sink with a custom vanity that matches the home's Craftsman style. The original hex tile was beyond saving, but we found a period-appropriate replacement that passes inspection by even the pickiest Dilworth neighbors."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Do I need a permit for bathroom remodeling in Charlotte?"

    a: "Yes—this is one of our specialties. We've worked extensively in Dilworth, Myers Park, Plaza Midwood, and Elizabeth where homes often have original galvanized pipes and cast iron drains. We know how to tie into existing systems properly and when full replacement makes more sense. Our team takes extra care to protect original features while bringing bathrooms up to modern standards."

Luxury renovations with heated floors, custom tile, and freestanding tubs can reach $50,000+. Charlotte labor costs are about 10-15% below national averages.

  - q: "Can you convert my bathtub to a walk-in shower?"
