  description: "A Pineville professional working from home ordered a complete home office from IKEA—two KALLAX shelving units, a BEKANT desk, a MARKUS chair, and a PAX wardrobe for office supply storage. We assembled everything in one afternoon, secured the shelving units to the wall for safety, organized cables behind the desk, and left the homeowner with a fully functional home office ready for Monday morning."
