  title: "Historic Myers Park Colonial Exterior"
  neighborhood: "Myers Park"
  description: "This 1940s Myers Park colonial hadn't been painted in 15 years. The wood siding had significant chalking and some areas of wood rot. We replaced rotted wood, scraped and sanded all surfaces, primed bare spots, and applied two coats of premium exterior paint. We matched the home's historic color scheme after researching original paint colors with the homeowners. The result: a paint job that respects the home's character while protecting it for the next decade."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What kind of paint works best for Charlotte's climate?"
    a: "Charlotte's humidity and temperature swings are tough on paint. For exteriors, we use premium acrylic latex paints with mildew resistance—Sherwin-Williams Duration or Benjamin Moore Aura Exterior are our go-to choices. For interiors, we recommend paints with good washability since Charlotte homes deal with dust and humidity. We're happy to discuss specific product recommendations for your project."
  - q: "How often should I repaint my Charlotte home's exterior?"
    a: "In Charlotte's climate, quality exterior paint typically lasts 7-10 years on properly prepped surfaces. Factors that affect longevity include sun exposure (south-facing walls fade faster), proximity to trees (more shade but more moisture/mildew), and quality of the original paint job. We see a lot of 'shortcuts' from other painters that lead to premature failure."
  - q: "Do you paint the intricate trim on Charlotte's older homes?"
    a: "Absolutely—detailed trim work is one of our specialties. Myers Park colonials, Dilworth bungalows, and Elizabeth Victorians all have beautiful architectural details that deserve careful attention. We take the time to properly prep, prime, and paint trim work. It's slower than spray-and-pray, but the results speak for themselves."
  - q: "Can you match existing paint colors on my Charlotte home?"
    a: "Yes, we can match virtually any existing color. We use spectrophotometer color matching technology to get exact matches. For historic homes, we can also research period-appropriate colors if you want to restore original color schemes. Many Dilworth and Myers Park homeowners appreciate this option."

localInfo:
  permits: "Interior and exterior painting typically doesn't require permits in Mecklenburg County unless it's part of a larger renovation. However, some Charlotte historic districts have guidelines about exterior colors—we can help you navigate these requirements."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows EPA lead paint regulations for homes built before 1978. We're EPA Lead-Safe Certified and follow all required protocols for testing and containment when working on older Charlotte homes."
  hoaConsiderations: "Many Charlotte HOAs require approval for exterior color changes. Some communities (especially in Ballantyne and South Charlotte) have strict color palettes. We can help you select colors that meet HOA requirements and still achieve your vision."
