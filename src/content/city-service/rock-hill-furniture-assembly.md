localIntro: "That IKEA box in your garage isn't going to assemble itself. Neither is the Wayfair bed frame, the Amazon desk, or the Costco patio set. Rock Hill homeowners call iFixx when they'd rather spend their Saturday doing anything other than deciphering instruction manuals. We assemble furniture fast and correctly throughout York County—Lake Wylie, Tega Cay, Fort Mill, and beyond. We bring the tools, the patience, and the experience to get it done right the first time."

  neighborhood: "Lake Wylie"
  description: "This Lake Wylie homeowner had converted their garage into a home gym and ordered all new equipment: a Bowflex home gym system, an adjustable weight bench, a squat rack with pull-up bar, heavy-duty storage shelves, and rubber floor mats. Everything arrived in boxes—lots of boxes. We assembled the entire gym in one day, including bolting the squat rack to the floor for safety, calibrating the Bowflex cable system, and organizing their weights on the new shelves. The homeowner walked into a fully functional gym."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does furniture assembly cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Most furniture assembly runs $50-150 per piece depending on complexity. Simple items (basic bookshelf, nightstand) start around $50. Complex items (PAX wardrobes, sectional sofas, large bed frames) run $100-200. We quote based on the specific items—send us photos or links and we'll give you an exact price."
  - q: "Do you assemble IKEA furniture?"
    a: "Yes—IKEA is probably our most common furniture assembly. PAX wardrobes, HEMNES dressers, KALLAX shelving, MALM beds... we've built them all. We know the IKEA system well enough to spot the common mistakes before they happen."
  - q: "Can you assemble furniture I ordered online?"
    a: "Absolutely. Wayfair, Amazon, Overstock, Costco, Walmart—wherever you ordered it from, we can assemble it. Just make sure all the boxes have arrived and check for missing parts before we come out."
  - q: "Do you assemble exercise equipment?"
    a: "Yes. Treadmills, ellipticals, home gym systems, squat racks, weight benches—we assemble it all. Exercise equipment often requires calibration and leveling that goes beyond basic assembly. We ensure everything works correctly when we leave."
  - q: "Do you dispose of the packaging?"
    a: "Yes, we can haul away boxes and packaging for a small additional fee (typically $25-50 depending on volume). Otherwise, we'll break down boxes and leave them for your recycling."
  - q: "What if parts are missing or damaged?"
    a: "We'll identify missing or damaged parts and advise on next steps (usually contacting the manufacturer). We don't charge for incomplete assemblies caused by manufacturer issues—we'll come back when you have the parts."
  - q: "Can you disassemble furniture for moving?"
    a: "Yes. We disassemble furniture for moves, label parts, and bag hardware so reassembly goes smoothly. Helpful for complex IKEA items or getting large furniture through doorways."
  - q: "How fast can you come out?"
    a: "We often have same-day availability for furniture assembly in Rock Hill, Tega Cay, Fort Mill, and Lake Wylie. Call or text and we'll let you know our earliest opening."

localInfo:
  permits: "Furniture assembly doesn't require permits."
  regulations: "Some exercise equipment (especially treadmills and cable systems) should be on appropriate flooring and may need floor protection. Tall furniture should be anchored to walls for safety, especially in homes with children."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior furniture assembly doesn't require HOA approval."
