localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does door installation cost in Monroe?"
    a: "Door installation costs in Monroe depend on the door type. Interior door installation runs $100-$200 labor (door not included). Exterior door installation runs $200-$400 labor, more for complex installations with sidelights. We provide exact pricing for your specific project."
  - q: "Do you sell doors or do I need to buy my own?"
    a: "Both options work. We can supply and install doors from our trusted suppliers, or we're happy to install customer-provided doors. If you're buying your own, we can advise on what to look for to ensure proper fit."
  - q: "Can you fix a door that won't close properly?"
    a: "Yes, this is a common service call. Doors often stick or won't latch due to settling, humidity changes, or worn hardware. We can adjust hinges, plane edges, replace strike plates, or address structural issues causing the problem."
  - q: "Do you replace window glass?"
    a: "Yes, we replace broken or fogged window glass. For double-pane windows with failed seals (foggy appearance), we can replace the glass unit without replacing the entire window frame in most cases."
  - q: "Can you install storm doors?"
    a: "Absolutely. Storm doors add a layer of protection and insulation to your entry. We install all types of storm doors and can recommend options based on your needs and budget."
  - q: "Do you repair window screens?"
    a: "Yes, we repair and replace window and door screens. We can re-screen existing frames or install new screen frames. Pet-resistant screen options are available for homes with dogs or cats."

localInfo:
  permits: "Door and window replacement typically doesn't require permits in Monroe unless you're changing rough opening sizes. New window openings require permits and structural consideration."
  regulations: "We follow NC building codes for door and window installation, including proper flashing and weatherproofing for exterior openings."
  hoaConsiderations: "Some Monroe subdivisions have requirements for exterior door and window styles. We recommend checking HOA guidelines before making changes."
