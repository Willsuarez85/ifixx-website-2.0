localFaqs:
  - q: "Can you install ceiling fans in my Ballantyne home?"
    a: "If there's already a fan-rated electrical box, yes. Most Ballantyne homes built for ceiling fans have the proper boxes. If you only have a light fixture box, an electrician needs to upgrade it first. We can check what you have and advise."
  - q: "How much to replace outlets in Ballantyne?"
    a: "Standard outlet: $25-40 each. GFCI outlet: $40-60 installed. USB outlet: $50-70 installed. We offer package pricing for multiple outlets—common in Ballantyne homes needing whole-house updates."
  - q: "My builder-grade light fixtures are ugly. Can you upgrade them?"
    a: "Absolutely—this is one of our most popular Ballantyne services. Builder-grade fixtures are the #1 complaint in newer homes. We swap them for your new fixtures, ensure proper mounting, and haul away the old ones."
  - q: "Do you install EV chargers?"
    a: "No—EV charger installation requires new circuits and a licensed electrician. We handle fixture-level work only. Happy to recommend an electrician for your EV charger."
