  neighborhood: "Lake Park"
  description: "A Lake Park family wanted their new 75-inch TV mounted above the fireplace with all cables hidden. We installed a tilting mount rated for the TV's weight, ran cables through the wall to an outlet below, and mounted a soundbar beneath the TV. The result is a clean, theater-like setup with no visible wires."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does TV mounting cost in Monroe?"
    a: "TV mounting in Monroe typically costs $100-$200 for a basic mount on a standard wall. Cable concealment adds $75-$150 depending on wall type. Above-fireplace mounts and full-motion mounts may cost more due to complexity. We provide exact pricing before starting."
  - q: "Do you supply the TV mount or do I need to buy one?"
    a: "Both options work. We can supply quality mounts in fixed, tilting, or full-motion styles, or we're happy to install a mount you've purchased. If you're buying your own, verify it's rated for your TV's weight and size."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV above my fireplace?"
    a: "Yes, above-fireplace mounting is a popular request. We typically use tilting mounts to optimize viewing angle. For gas fireplaces, we verify heat output is safe for the TV. Cable concealment may require surface raceway depending on fireplace construction."
  - q: "Can you hide the cables in the wall?"
    a: "Yes, in-wall cable concealment is our most popular add-on. We cut small access holes, run cables through the wall, and install plates for a clean finish. For fireplaces and some wall types, surface raceways provide a neat alternative."
  - q: "What about mounting on brick or stone?"
    a: "We mount TVs on brick and stone walls using appropriate masonry hardware. These installations require specialized anchors and careful drilling. We have the tools and experience for masonry mounting."
  - q: "Do you mount soundbars?"
    a: "Yes, we mount soundbars below the TV for integrated audio. We can also run soundbar power and connections through the wall for a completely clean look."

localInfo:
  permits: "TV mounting doesn't require permits in Monroe or Union County."
  regulations: "We follow manufacturer specifications for mount installation and ensure proper support in wall construction."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior TV mounting doesn't require HOA approval. Outdoor TV mounting on exterior walls may need review in some Monroe subdivisions."

## Why Monroe Homeowners Choose iFixx

### Secure, Level Installations

A TV falling off the wall is dangerous and expensive. We ensure every mount is:
- Anchored into wall studs (not just drywall)
- Rated for your TV's weight plus safety margin
- Level and properly positioned
- Tested for stability before we leave

### Clean Cable Management

Visible cables ruin the clean look of a mounted TV. Our cable concealment options:
- **In-wall**: Cables hidden completely behind drywall
- **Raceway**: Surface-mounted channel that matches wall color
- **Cord covers**: Fabric sleeves that blend with wall

We recommend in-wall concealment for most installations—it's the cleanest look and adds value to your home.

### Optimal Viewing Position

TV height and angle affect your viewing comfort. We consider:
- Seating distance and height
- Room lighting and glare
- Multiple viewing areas
- Fireplace heat (for above-fireplace mounts)
