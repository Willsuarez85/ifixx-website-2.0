  description: "A Pineville family wanted a custom built-in to replace their mismatched furniture and hide electronics clutter. We designed and built a floor-to-ceiling unit with adjustable shelving, closed cabinets for storage, a niche for their 65-inch TV, and integrated lighting. The piece was built on-site, painted to match the room's trim, and transformed the living room into a showpiece."
