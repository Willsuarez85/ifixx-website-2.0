  neighborhood: "Plantation Estates"
  description: "This Plantation Estates homeowner woke up to a cold shower—their 12-year-old water heater had failed overnight. They called us and we were there within 3 hours. We drained the old tank, removed it, and installed a new 50-gallon water heater with an expansion tank and updated connections. By evening, they had hot water again. We also inspected their other plumbing and identified a slow leak under the kitchen sink that we fixed on the spot."
