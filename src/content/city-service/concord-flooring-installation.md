  neighborhood: "Weddington Trace"
  description: "A Weddington Trace family wanted to replace their worn carpet and dated tile with a cohesive look throughout their home. We installed 2,000 square feet of luxury vinyl plank flooring throughout the main level—living room, dining room, kitchen, and hallways. We removed the old flooring, addressed subfloor issues, installed proper underlayment, and completed the job with new baseboards and transitions. The result was a beautiful, durable floor that unified the entire space."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does flooring installation cost in Concord?"
    a: "Labor for flooring installation in Concord typically runs $2-$4 per square foot for LVP/laminate, $4-$8 per square foot for tile, and $4-$6 per square foot for hardwood. Material costs are additional. A 500 sq ft living room with LVP might cost $2,000-$4,000 total including materials."
  - q: "What's the best flooring for Concord homes?"
    a: "Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) has become the most popular choice for its durability, water resistance, and realistic wood look. It handles Concord's humidity well and works in any room. Tile is great for bathrooms and entryways. Hardwood adds timeless value for those who prefer natural materials."
  - q: "How long does flooring installation take?"
    a: "A typical room takes 1 day for LVP or laminate. Whole-house projects (1,500-2,500 sq ft) typically take 3-5 days. Tile takes longer due to setting and grouting time. We'll give you a timeline during your estimate."
  - q: "Do you remove old flooring?"
    a: "Yes, we handle complete flooring projects: remove old carpet, tile, or damaged flooring, prepare the subfloor, and install your new floors. Old flooring removal is included in our quotes."
  - q: "Do you install tile flooring?"
    a: "Absolutely. We install ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tile in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, and entryways. We handle everything from simple layouts to more complex patterns."
  - q: "Can you refinish existing hardwood floors?"
    a: "For full hardwood refinishing (sanding and multiple coats), we recommend specialists with dedicated equipment. We can handle spot repairs, screening and recoating, and small refinishing projects."
  - q: "What about baseboards with new flooring?"
    a: "Options include removing and reinstalling existing baseboards, installing shoe molding to cover the expansion gap, or installing new baseboards. We'll recommend the best approach for your situation."
  - q: "Do I need to move furniture before installation?"
    a: "Yes, the rooms should be cleared of furniture before we arrive. We can help move heavy items for an additional charge, or you can arrange moving yourself."

localInfo:
  permits: "Flooring installation typically doesn't require permits in Concord or Cabarrus County. Subfloor structural repairs may require permits if significant."
  regulations: "We follow manufacturer specifications for installation, including proper underlayment, expansion gaps, and transition requirements."
  hoaConsiderations: "Some Concord condos and townhomes have flooring restrictions for noise control (requiring certain underlayment or prohibiting hard flooring above first floor). Check your HOA rules before selecting flooring."
