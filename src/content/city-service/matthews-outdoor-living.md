From a simple deck addition to a complete backyard transformation, we create spaces where memories happen."

  description: "The Chen family wanted their backyard to become the neighborhood gathering spot. We designed and built a 450 sq ft composite deck off their back door with wide steps leading to a paver patio area. The patio features a built-in gas firepit surrounded by a curved seating wall, plus a designated grilling station with counter space. String lights on posts complete the atmosphere. Now their backyard hosts everything from kids' birthday parties to adult cocktail nights."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What outdoor living services do you offer in Matthews?"
    a: "We build custom decks (wood and composite), patios, pergolas and shade structures, screen porches, firepits, outdoor lighting, and grilling stations. We handle the complete design and construction process including permits."
  - q: "How much does a deck cost in Matthews?"
    a: "Deck costs depend on size, materials, and features. Composite decking typically runs $40-$60 per square foot installed in Matthews. A standard 300 sq ft deck costs $12,000-$18,000. Pressure-treated wood is more affordable at $25-$40 per square foot. We provide detailed estimates for your specific project."
  - q: "What decking material do you recommend for Matthews?"
    a: "For most Matthews families, we recommend composite decking (Trex, TimberTech). It handles Charlotte's humidity and heat without warping, won't splinter around bare feet, and requires minimal maintenance—no annual staining. Pressure-treated wood is a budget-friendly option if you don't mind regular maintenance."
  - q: "Can you build a firepit area?"
    a: "Yes, firepits are one of our most popular projects for Matthews backyards. We build both gas and wood-burning options, with paver patios, seating walls, and proper drainage. A firepit extends your outdoor season well into Charlotte's cool fall evenings."
  - q: "Do I need a permit for a deck in Matthews?"
    a: "Mecklenburg County requires permits for deck construction. Permits ensure proper footings, structural connections, and safety railings. We handle all permit applications, required drawings, and inspections."
  - q: "How long does it take to build a deck?"
    a: "Timeline depends on scope and permit approval. A standard deck takes 1-2 weeks after permit approval. Adding pergolas, firepits, or screen enclosures extends the timeline. We'll provide specific timing based on your project."

localInfo:
  permits: "Mecklenburg County requires permits for decks, attached pergolas, and covered structures. We handle all permit applications, drawings, and inspections."
