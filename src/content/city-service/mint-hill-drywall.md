  description: "A Mint Hill homeowner discovered water damage in their master bedroom ceiling after a roof leak. We removed all damaged drywall, ensured the area was dry, installed new drywall, taped and mudded the seams, and matched the existing texture. After priming and painting, the repair was completely invisible. The result? A ceiling that looks like nothing ever happened."
