  title: "Unionville Farmhouse Kitchen Renovation"
  neighborhood: "Unionville"
  description: "When a Unionville family decided to update their 1980s kitchen, they wanted modern function without losing the farmhouse feel. We installed custom shaker cabinets in a soft gray, added a large island with butcher block top, upgraded to quartz perimeter counters, and installed a farmhouse sink. New pendant lighting and subway tile backsplash completed the look. The kitchen now serves as the heart of their home for family gatherings."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Monroe?"
    a: "Kitchen remodel costs in Monroe typically range from $12,000-$22,000 for a minor refresh (new countertops, cabinet refacing, updated fixtures) to $35,000-$65,000+ for a full renovation with custom cabinets, new layout, and premium finishes. Union County labor costs are lower than Charlotte, making your investment go further. We provide detailed estimates upfront."
  - q: "Do I need a permit for kitchen remodeling in Monroe?"
    a: "Union County requires permits when moving plumbing, adding electrical circuits, or making structural changes like removing walls. Cosmetic updates like replacing cabinets or countertops typically don't need permits. We handle the permit process when needed."
  - q: "How long does a typical Monroe kitchen remodel take?"
    a: "For a full kitchen renovation in Monroe, expect 4-8 weeks depending on scope. Custom cabinets typically take 4-6 weeks to arrive, while stock options are faster. We coordinate with suppliers to minimize delays."
  - q: "Can you add an island if my home is on septic?"
    a: "Yes, but it requires careful planning. Adding a sink to an island means running drain and vent lines, which must be done properly on septic systems. We've handled this for many Union County homeowners and know the requirements."
  - q: "Do you work with older homes in Downtown Monroe?"
    a: "Absolutely. Older homes often have unique challenges—non-standard cabinet dimensions, older wiring, and original flooring that needs protecting. We've worked with many historic properties and know how to preserve character while adding modern function."
  - q: "What's included in a kitchen remodel quote?"
    a: "Our quotes include everything: demolition, materials, labor, permits, inspections, and cleanup. We itemize each component so you see exactly where your investment goes. No hidden fees, no surprise charges."
