  neighborhood: "Fairview"
  description: "A Fairview homeowner wanted to convert an awkward alcove in their living room into functional storage. We designed and built a floor-to-ceiling bookcase with adjustable shelves, cabinet storage at the base, and crown molding that matched the existing room trim. The custom piece transformed dead space into the focal point of the room."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What carpentry services do you offer in Monroe?"
    a: "We handle a wide range of carpentry—trim installation (baseboards, crown molding, window/door casing), built-in cabinets and shelving, structural repairs, deck repairs, rot repair, and custom wood projects. We can assess your project and provide options."
  - q: "How much does trim installation cost in Monroe?"
    a: "Trim installation in Monroe typically costs $3-$6 per linear foot for baseboards, $5-$10 for crown molding, depending on style and complexity. Whole-room or whole-house trim projects are more economical per foot. We provide exact pricing for your project."
  - q: "Can you repair rotted wood on my home's exterior?"
    a: "Yes, rot repair is a specialty. We remove rotted sections, treat remaining wood to prevent spread, and install new material that matches existing trim. This is critical for Union County homes where humidity can accelerate wood decay."
  - q: "Do you build custom shelving and built-ins?"
    a: "Absolutely. Custom built-ins transform unused space into functional storage. We design and build bookcases, entertainment centers, window seats with storage, and closet systems. We match existing trim and finishes for a cohesive look."
  - q: "Can you repair my deck?"
    a: "Yes, we handle deck repairs throughout Monroe. This includes replacing damaged boards, reinforcing structural members, fixing railings, and addressing rot. For extensive damage, we can advise on repair vs. replacement."
  - q: "Do you work with older homes in Downtown Monroe?"
    a: "Yes, we have experience with Union County's older homes. Matching historic trim profiles, working with old-growth lumber, and preserving character while improving function are all part of our approach."

localInfo:
  permits: "Carpentry work typically doesn't require permits unless it involves structural changes. Deck repairs may require permits depending on scope."
  regulations: "We follow NC building codes for all structural carpentry work. Deck repairs meet current safety standards."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior carpentry doesn't require HOA approval. Exterior changes like deck repairs or trim changes may need review in some Monroe subdivisions."
