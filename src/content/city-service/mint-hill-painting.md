  neighborhood: "Downtown Mint Hill"
  description: "An established Mint Hill home needed a complete exterior refresh after years of Carolina weather. We power-washed all surfaces, scraped and sanded peeling areas, primed bare wood, caulked gaps, and applied two coats of premium exterior paint. We also painted the shutters, front door, and trim in complementary colors. The result? A home that looks brand new and is protected for years to come."
