  neighborhood: "Downtown Mint Hill"
  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted to convert their unfinished basement into a guest suite with bathroom. We framed the space including a bedroom, bathroom, and living area, installed drywall throughout, added a bathroom with shower, installed LVP flooring, and finished with paint and trim. We also added recessed lighting and ensured proper egress. The result? A comfortable guest suite that effectively doubled the home's usable living space."

  - q: "How much does basement finishing cost in Mint Hill?"
    a: "Basement finishing in Mint Hill typically costs $30-$50 per square foot for basic finishing (framing, drywall, flooring, paint) and $50-$80+ per square foot for complete buildouts with bathrooms, kitchens, or custom features. A 1,000 sq ft basement might cost $30,000-$80,000 depending on scope. We provide detailed estimates after assessing your space."
  - q: "How long does basement finishing take?"
    a: "A basic basement finish (framing, drywall, flooring, paint) typically takes 4-6 weeks. More complex projects with bathrooms, custom features, or extensive work take 8-12 weeks. We'll provide a timeline specific to your project during the planning phase."
  - q: "Do I need permits for basement finishing in Mint Hill?"
    a: "Yes, basement finishing in Mecklenburg County requires building permits. Permits are needed for framing, electrical, and any fixture work. We handle the entire permit process including applications, inspections, and final approval."
  - q: "Can you add a bathroom to my basement?"
    a: "Yes, basement bathroom additions are common in our projects. If you have a rough-in (drain lines already in place), the cost is lower. If we need to break concrete and add drainage, it costs more but is very doable. We'll assess your situation and provide options."
  - q: "What about egress requirements in Mint Hill?"
    a: "Any basement bedroom requires an egress window or door for safety and code compliance. We can install egress window wells and windows as part of your basement finishing project. This is required for bedrooms but beneficial for any finished basement."
