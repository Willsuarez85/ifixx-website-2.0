  title: "French Door Repair in Lake Wylie"
  neighborhood: "Lake Wylie"
  description: "This Lake Wylie homeowner had beautiful French doors leading to their deck, but one door wouldn't latch properly and both had drafty weatherstripping. Over time, the house had settled slightly, throwing off the door alignment. We adjusted the hinges, planed the door edge where it was binding, installed new weatherstripping around both doors, and adjusted the strike plate for a perfect latch. The doors now close smoothly and seal properly—no cold drafts or difficulty latching. Total time: 3 hours."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does door repair cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Simple repairs (adjustments, hardware replacement) run $75-150. More complex repairs (binding doors, damaged frames) range from $150-300. Pre-hung door installation starts around $200-400 for labor plus the door cost. We quote everything upfront after seeing the issue."
  - q: "My doors stick in summer but work fine in winter. Why?"
    a: "South Carolina humidity causes wood doors to swell in summer. This is especially common in older Rock Hill homes with solid wood doors. Options include planing the door edge (permanent fix), adjusting hinges, or addressing moisture sources. We can assess your specific situation and recommend the best approach."
  - q: "Can you install a new exterior door?"
    a: "Yes, we install pre-hung doors (door already mounted in frame). If your existing frame is in good shape, we can also hang a new door slab in the existing frame. Custom door openings (changing the size) may require framing work and permits."
  - q: "Do you repair windows or just replace them?"
    a: "We repair first. Many window problems—broken sash cords, stuck windows, failed weatherstripping, broken locks—can be fixed without replacement. We're not a window company trying to sell you new windows. If repair makes sense, that's what we recommend. If windows truly need replacement, we'll tell you and can recommend specialists."
  - q: "Can you fix a window that won't stay open?"
    a: "Usually, yes. In older windows, this is often a broken sash cord or failed balance spring. In newer windows, the balance mechanism may have failed. We carry common replacement parts and can usually fix this same-day."
  - q: "Do you install storm doors?"
    a: "Yes. Storm door installation typically takes 2-3 hours and costs $150-250 for labor plus the door. Proper installation ensures the door operates smoothly and seals correctly."
  - q: "My sliding glass door is hard to open. Can you fix that?"
    a: "Usually, yes. Common causes: dirty or damaged track, worn rollers, misaligned door. We clean and lubricate tracks, replace rollers if needed, and adjust alignment. This usually solves the problem without door replacement."

localInfo:
  permits: "Door and window repairs typically don't require permits. Changing door or window sizes (new openings) does require permits in York County."
  regulations: "Exterior doors must meet egress requirements. Building code specifies minimum sizes and opening requirements for bedroom windows. We ensure all work meets current codes."
  hoaConsiderations: "Changing exterior door or window styles, colors, or sizes may require HOA approval in Tega Cay, Lake Wylie, and Fort Mill communities. Repairs maintaining existing appearance typically don't need approval."

### Common Door Problems in Rock Hill

**Seasonal Sticking**: Wood doors swell in humid South Carolina summers. We can plane door edges or adjust hinges for a permanent solution.

**Settlement Issues**: Older homes and new construction alike can settle, throwing doors out of alignment. Hinge adjustments and strike plate repositioning usually solve this.

**Weatherstripping Failure**: Old weatherstripping lets in drafts, bugs, and noise. Replacement is inexpensive and makes a noticeable difference in comfort.

**Hardware Wear**: Locks, handles, and hinges wear out over time. Replacement is straightforward and much cheaper than a new door.

### Common Window Problems

**Won't Stay Open**: Usually broken sash cords (older windows) or failed balance springs (newer). Parts are available for most window brands.

**Hard to Open/Close**: Paint buildup, debris in tracks, or failed hardware. Usually fixable with cleaning, lubrication, or minor adjustments.

**Drafty Frames**: Weatherstripping wears out. Replacement seals significantly improve comfort and energy efficiency.
