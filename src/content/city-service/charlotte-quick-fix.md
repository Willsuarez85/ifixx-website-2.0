  neighborhood: "SouthPark"
  description: "When the Johnsons bought their SouthPark condo, the inspector flagged a dozen small issues: a running toilet, three doors that stuck, missing outlet covers, a wobbly ceiling fan, loose cabinet hardware, and more. Instead of calling multiple contractors, they called us. Our team knocked out the entire punch list in one 4-hour visit. The condo was move-in ready, and the Johnsons started their new chapter without a single repair hanging over their heads."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What does Quick Fix service cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Most quick fix items run $75-$200 each. We also offer hourly rates for multiple small repairs: $85-$125/hour depending on complexity. Many Charlotte homeowners book 2-4 hour blocks to knock out their entire honey-do list at once. We provide upfront pricing—no surprises."
  - q: "What repairs are included in Quick Fix?"
    a: "Quick Fix covers everyday home repairs: fixture replacement (faucets, toilets, garbage disposals), door and window adjustments, drywall patching, caulking, weatherstripping, light fixture and ceiling fan installation, minor carpentry, and more. If it's on your honey-do list, we probably handle it."
  - q: "Can you fix a running toilet or dripping faucet?"
    a: "Absolutely—fixture repair is one of our most common calls. We fix running toilets, dripping faucets, slow drains, and garbage disposal issues. We carry common parts and can often complete these repairs in a single visit."
  - q: "Do you install ceiling fans?"
    a: "Yes, ceiling fan installation is a popular Quick Fix service. We remove old fixtures, install new fans, and ensure proper balance and operation. If additional support bracing is needed, we handle that too."
  - q: "Can you fix doors that stick or won't close?"
    a: "Yes, door adjustment is something we do daily. Charlotte's humidity causes doors to swell and stick seasonally. We plane, adjust hinges, fix latches, and replace weatherstripping to get doors working properly."
  - q: "What about drywall holes and wall damage?"
    a: "We patch drywall holes from small nail holes to larger damage. For significant repairs, we match texture and can do paint touch-ups. Most patches are complete and ready for painting within a few hours."
  - q: "Do you do painting?"
    a: "We do touch-up painting and small jobs (accent walls, single rooms). For full-house painting projects, we can refer you to our painting partners, but Quick Fix covers the small stuff."
  - q: "How fast can you get here?"
    a: "We offer same-day service when available, and next-day for most appointments. For urgent repairs, call us directly—we prioritize emergencies and try to accommodate tight schedules."

localInfo:
  permits: "Most quick fix repairs don't require permits in Mecklenburg County. Permits may be needed for certain fixture installations or if work involves concealed systems. We advise when permits are necessary."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows NC State Building Code. GFCI outlets required in kitchens, bathrooms, and exterior locations. Smoke and CO detectors must meet current code when replaced."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior quick fix repairs don't typically require HOA approval. Exterior work like door replacement or fixture changes may require review in some Charlotte communities."
