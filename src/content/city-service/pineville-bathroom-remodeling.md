  description: "A growing family needed to update their cramped master bathroom in a 1990s colonial. We removed the dated garden tub (rarely used), expanded the walk-in shower with frameless glass doors, installed dual vanities with quartz countertops, and added modern tile flooring. New lighting and a fresh coat of paint completed the transformation. The result is a spa-like retreat that makes mornings easier for the whole family."

We remove the old tub, waterproof the area, install a custom tile shower with your choice of fixtures, and add a frameless glass enclosure. It's a great way to modernize your bathroom and increase functionality."
  - q: "Do you work with small bathrooms?"
    a: "Absolutely. Many Pineville homes have smaller guest baths and half-baths that need creative solutions. We maximize space with smart storage, appropriate fixtures, and design choices that make small bathrooms feel larger."

  - q: "What's included in a bathroom remodel quote?"
    a: "Our quotes include demolition, materials, labor, permits (if needed), and cleanup. We itemize everything so you see where your investment goes. No hidden fees—what we quote is what you pay."
  - q: "How do I prepare for a bathroom remodel?"
