localIntro: "Charlotte's mild climate means outdoor living is a year-round lifestyle—from spring evenings on Myers Park patios to fall gatherings around Ballantyne fire pits. Our outdoor living team builds and repairs decks, patios, pergolas, and outdoor structures across the Queen City, understanding how Carolina weather affects materials and what designs work best for our neighborhoods. Whether you're upgrading a tired deck in Dilworth, adding a screened porch in South Charlotte, or building an outdoor kitchen in Plaza Midwood, we bring the expertise to extend your living space outdoors."

  neighborhood: "Myers Park"
  description: "The Williams family wanted to enjoy their Myers Park backyard without battling Charlotte's mosquitoes. We designed and built a 16x20 screened porch off their living room, featuring a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams, composite decking, retractable screens, and integrated ceiling fans with lighting. The porch connects seamlessly to the existing home and provides three-season outdoor living space. The family now hosts dinners outside from March through November."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does a new deck cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Deck costs in Charlotte range from $25-$40/sq ft for pressure-treated lumber to $45-$75/sq ft for composite decking. A typical 300 sq ft deck runs $7,500-$22,500 depending on materials, railing style, and complexity. Multi-level decks and those requiring significant structural work cost more. We provide detailed quotes after seeing your space."
  - q: "What decking material is best for Charlotte's climate?"
    a: "Composite decking handles Charlotte's humidity and weather best—it won't rot, warp, or require annual sealing. Pressure-treated lumber is budget-friendly but needs maintenance. Ipe and other hardwoods look beautiful but are premium-priced. We discuss options during your consultation and help you choose based on budget and lifestyle."
  - q: "Do I need a permit to build a deck in Charlotte?"
    a: "Yes, Mecklenburg County requires permits for decks over 30 inches above grade or larger than 200 square feet. Permits are also required if the deck attaches to the house. We handle the entire permit process—application, plans, and inspections."
  - q: "How long does deck construction take?"
    a: "A straightforward deck (200-400 sq ft) takes 3-5 days to build. Larger or multi-level decks take 1-2 weeks. Add permit processing time (5-10 business days in Mecklenburg County) to the front end. Complex projects with stairs, built-in seating, or outdoor kitchens take longer."
  - q: "Can you repair my existing deck?"
    a: "Yes, deck repair is a significant part of our business. Charlotte's humidity is tough on outdoor wood—we see rotted boards, loose railings, wobbly stairs, and structural issues regularly. We can repair, resurface, or rebuild depending on what makes sense for your deck's condition."
  - q: "Do you build screened porches?"
    a: "Yes, screened porches are popular in Charlotte for good reason—they extend your outdoor season while keeping bugs out. We build new screened porches and convert existing decks or patios to screened spaces. Options include retractable screens, ceiling fans, lighting, and three-season features."
  - q: "What about pergolas and shade structures?"
    a: "We build pergolas, gazebos, and shade structures in wood, vinyl, and aluminum. Pergolas are great for defining outdoor spaces and supporting climbing plants. We can add retractable canopies for adjustable shade."
  - q: "Can you build outdoor kitchens?"
    a: "Yes, we build outdoor kitchens ranging from simple grill stations to complete setups with counters, sinks, refrigerators, and storage. We work with your existing utilities and can coordinate fixture installation for sinks and gas lines."

localInfo:
  permits: "Mecklenburg County requires building permits for decks over 30 inches high, larger than 200 sq ft, or attached to the house. Screened porches and additions also require permits. Typical approval takes 5-10 business days."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows NC State Building Code. Deck railings required for surfaces more than 30 inches above grade. Setback requirements apply. Footings must reach below frost line."
  hoaConsiderations: "Many Charlotte HOAs require architectural review for decks, porches, and outdoor structures. Ballantyne, Providence Plantation, and SouthPark communities often have specific material, color, and design requirements. We help navigate HOA approval processes."
