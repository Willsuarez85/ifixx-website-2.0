  title: "Full Interior Repaint in Tega Cay"
  neighborhood: "Tega Cay"
  description: "This Tega Cay family had just purchased a home with beige walls throughout—every room the same builder-grade color. They wanted a fresh, modern look with different colors for each space. We painted the entire 2,800 sq ft interior: light gray in the living areas, navy blue accent wall in the master bedroom, soft green in the kids' rooms, and crisp white trim throughout. We moved furniture, protected floors with drop cloths, and left each room cleaner than we found it. The project took four days, and the homeowners were amazed at the transformation."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does interior painting cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Interior painting in Rock Hill typically runs $2-4 per square foot for walls, depending on ceiling height, prep work needed, and paint quality. A typical 12x12 bedroom costs $300-600 including labor and paint. Full home interiors range from $3,000-$8,000 depending on size. We provide free, detailed estimates with no surprises."
  - q: "How long does it take to paint a house interior in Rock Hill?"
    a: "A single room takes 1 day. A full interior (average 2,000-3,000 sq ft home) typically takes 3-5 days including prep, priming, two coats, and cleanup. We don't rush—proper prep and drying time between coats ensures results that last."
  - q: "Do you do exterior painting in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Yes, we handle exterior painting throughout York County. Exterior projects depend heavily on weather—South Carolina heat and humidity affect timing. We recommend exterior painting in spring or fall for best results. Exterior painting typically runs $3,000-$8,000+ depending on home size and prep work required."
  - q: "What about painting in older Downtown Rock Hill homes?"
    a: "Older homes require more prep work—scraping loose paint, repairing cracks, priming bare wood. Homes built before 1978 may have lead paint, which requires special handling. We assess every project and quote accordingly. The extra prep is worth it for results that last."
  - q: "Can you paint kitchen cabinets?"
    a: "Yes—cabinet painting is a cost-effective alternative to replacement. We properly prep, prime, and apply multiple coats for a factory-like finish. Cabinet painting typically costs $2,000-$5,000 depending on kitchen size. Takes 3-5 days with proper drying time between coats."
  - q: "What paint brands do you use?"
    a: "We typically use Sherwin-Williams or Benjamin Moore—both available locally in Rock Hill. These premium paints cover better, last longer, and come in virtually any color. We can work with other brands if you have a preference or have already purchased paint."
  - q: "Do I need to move furniture before you paint?"
    a: "We handle furniture moving. We'll shift everything to the center of the room and cover it with drop cloths. For large or fragile items, we'll discuss the best approach. Floors, fixtures, and anything we can't move gets protected with plastic and tape."

localInfo:
  permits: "Interior and exterior painting typically doesn't require permits in York County unless part of a larger renovation project."
  regulations: "Homes built before 1978 may contain lead paint. EPA RRP rules apply to disturbance of lead paint in older homes. We assess and follow proper protocols for older Rock Hill homes."
  hoaConsiderations: "Many Tega Cay, Lake Wylie, and Fort Mill HOAs have exterior color restrictions. Check your HOA guidelines before selecting exterior colors. Interior painting doesn't require HOA approval."

### Why Prep Work Matters

We don't skip steps. Before any paint goes on your walls:
- We fill nail holes and repair minor damage
- We sand rough areas for smooth finish
- We tape edges and protect floors/fixtures
- We prime where needed (new drywall, dark colors, stains)
- We apply two coats of quality paint

Shortcuts show. Proper prep is the difference between paint that looks good for a year and paint that looks good for a decade.
