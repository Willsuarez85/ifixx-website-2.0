  neighborhood: "Ardrey Kell"
  description: "The Garcias just moved into their Ardrey Kell home and had a list of things the previous owners left undone: toilet running constantly, three doors sticking, missing door stops throughout, loose towel bars in both bathrooms, garage door weather stripping hanging loose, smoke detectors chirping, and several outlet covers missing. Our handyman handled all seven items in a single morning visit, getting their new home in proper working order."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What repairs does Quick Fix cover?"
    a: "Quick Fix handles small repairs and installations: running toilets, leaky faucets, door adjustments, drywall patches, picture hanging, shelf mounting, light fixture replacement, ceiling fan installation, caulking, weather stripping, smoke detector installation, and more. Basically anything that takes under 2 hours per item."
  - q: "How much does Quick Fix service cost in Ballantyne?"
    a: "We offer hourly rates ($75-$95/hour with a 1-hour minimum) or flat rates for specific tasks. Multiple small items in one visit often make the hourly rate most economical. We'll discuss pricing options when you describe your list."
  - q: "Is there a minimum charge?"
    a: "Yes, there's a 1-hour minimum for Quick Fix visits. That's why we encourage making a list—combine multiple small repairs to get the most value from your service call."
  - q: "Can you fix plumbing fixtures?"
    a: "We handle fixture repairs—running toilets, leaky faucets, dripping showerheads, garbage disposal issues, and similar items. We repair and replace fixtures. For actual pipe work or drain issues, you'd need a specialized professional."
  - q: "Do you install ceiling fans and light fixtures?"
    a: "Yes, we install ceiling fans and light fixtures where a junction box already exists. This includes assembly, mounting, wiring to the existing circuit, and programming remotes. We don't run new electrical circuits—that would be a larger project."
  - q: "How quickly can you come to Ballantyne?"
    a: "We often have same-day or next-day availability in Ballantyne. For non-urgent repairs, we typically schedule within 2-3 days. Call or text for current availability."
  - q: "What if something turns out to be a bigger issue?"
    a: "If a 'quick fix' reveals a larger problem—like a door that needs reframing rather than adjustment—we'll explain what's actually needed and provide a quote. You decide whether to proceed. No surprises."

localInfo:
  permits: "Most Quick Fix repairs are maintenance items that don't require permits. Simple fixture replacements and minor repairs fall under normal homeowner maintenance."
  regulations: "We perform all Quick Fix work according to manufacturer specifications and industry best practices."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior Quick Fix repairs don't require Ballantyne HOA approval. Minor exterior items like mailbox repair may have HOA specifications we can follow."
