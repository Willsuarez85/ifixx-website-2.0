  neighborhood: "Clear Creek"
  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted built-in bookshelves and a window seat for their living room. We designed and built floor-to-ceiling shelving units flanking the window, added a cushioned window seat with hidden storage below, and installed matching trim throughout. All pieces were primed and painted to match the home's existing millwork. The result? A beautiful, functional space that looks like it was always part of the house."
