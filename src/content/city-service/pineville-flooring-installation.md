  neighborhood: "Carmel Commons"
  description: "A Pineville family with kids and pets wanted to replace their worn carpet and dated tile with durable, waterproof flooring. We installed luxury vinyl plank throughout the main level and upstairs hallway—over 1,500 square feet. The installation included removing old flooring, leveling subfloor where needed, installing new baseboards, and matching transitions throughout. The result? Beautiful, worry-free floors that look like hardwood."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does flooring installation cost in Pineville?"
    a: "Flooring costs in Pineville depend on material: Luxury vinyl plank runs $6-$12 per sq ft installed. Hardwood runs $10-$18 per sq ft installed. Tile runs $12-$20 per sq ft installed. Carpet runs $4-$8 per sq ft installed. We provide detailed quotes after measuring your space."
  - q: "What type of flooring do you recommend for Pineville homes?"
    a: "For most Pineville families, we recommend luxury vinyl plank (LVP). It's waterproof, scratch-resistant, comfortable underfoot, and looks like real hardwood. It handles the humidity and temperature swings of Carolina weather well."
  - q: "How long does flooring installation take?"
    a: "A typical room takes 1-2 days. A whole main floor (1,000-1,500 sq ft) typically takes 3-5 days including furniture moving, old floor removal, and installation. We provide a timeline with every quote."
  - q: "Do you remove old flooring?"
    a: "Yes, old flooring removal is included in our quotes. We remove carpet, vinyl, laminate, and tile (tile removal may have additional charges due to labor intensity). We also handle disposal."
  - q: "Do you move furniture for flooring installation?"
    a: "We move standard furniture as part of the installation. Heavy items like pianos, safes, or extremely large pieces may require special arrangements. We discuss this during the estimate."
  - q: "Can you install flooring over existing floors?"
    a: "In some cases, yes. LVP and laminate can often go over existing hard flooring if it's level and in good condition. We assess each situation to determine the best approach for lasting results."

localInfo:
  permits: "Flooring installation typically doesn't require permits in Pineville. If we're addressing subfloor structural issues, permits may apply—we handle this as needed."
  regulations: "We follow manufacturer installation guidelines and industry best practices for proper expansion gaps, transitions, and moisture management."
  hoaConsiderations: "Flooring is interior work and typically doesn't require HOA approval. Some townhome HOAs have noise requirements that may influence material choices—we can advise."
