  title: "Sardis Woods Kitchen Transformation"
  neighborhood: "Sardis Woods"
  description: "This Sardis Woods family had outgrown their 1990s kitchen—dated oak cabinets, limited counter space, and a layout that didn't work for their busy household. We removed a half-wall to open the kitchen to the family room, installed white shaker cabinets with a large island, added quartz countertops, and upgraded all appliances. The new layout includes a homework station for the kids and better flow for entertaining. The family now spends more time together in their favorite room."
