  neighborhood: "Wingate"
  description: "Expecting parents in Wingate purchased a complete nursery set—crib, changing table, dresser, glider, and bookshelf—all requiring assembly. We assembled everything in one afternoon, secured the dresser and bookshelf to the wall for safety, and left the room ready for baby's arrival. The parents could focus on the excitement instead of struggling with instructions."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does furniture assembly cost in Monroe?"
    a: "Furniture assembly in Monroe typically costs $50-$150 per item depending on complexity. Simple items like nightstands take 20-30 minutes ($50-$60), while complex items like bed frames or large entertainment centers take 1-2 hours ($100-$150+). We provide exact pricing based on what you need assembled."
  - q: "Do you assemble IKEA furniture?"

  - q: "Can you assemble multiple items in one visit?"
