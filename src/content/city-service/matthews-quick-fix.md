localIntro: "Life in Matthews keeps you busy—between work, kids' activities, and everything else, those small home repairs keep getting pushed off.

One call, one visit, multiple items crossed off the list. We serve Downtown Matthews, Stallings, Indian Trail, and surrounding areas."

  neighborhood: "Indian Trail"
  description: "The Rodriguez family just bought their Indian Trail home and inherited the previous owner's deferred maintenance: a toilet that ran constantly, two doors that wouldn't latch, missing doorstops throughout, a loose towel bar, several cracked outlet covers, wobbly cabinet hardware in the kitchen, and a dripping bathroom faucet. Our handyman handled everything in a single three-hour visit, turning their new house into a properly functioning home."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What repairs does Quick Fix cover?"
    a: "Quick Fix handles small repairs and installations: running toilets, dripping faucets, door adjustments, drywall patches, picture hanging, shelf mounting, light fixture swaps, ceiling fan installation, caulking, weather stripping, smoke detector installation, and more. Anything that takes under 2 hours per item."
  - q: "How much does Quick Fix service cost in Matthews?"
    a: "We offer hourly rates ($65-$85/hour with a 1-hour minimum) or flat rates for specific tasks. Multiple small items in one visit often make the hourly rate most economical. We'll discuss pricing options when you describe your list."
  - q: "Is there a minimum charge?"
    a: "Yes, there's a 1-hour minimum for Quick Fix visits. That's why we encourage you to make a list—combine multiple small repairs to get the most value from your service call."
  - q: "Can you fix toilet and faucet issues?"
    a: "We handle fixture repairs—running toilets, dripping faucets, leaky showerheads, garbage disposal issues, and similar items. We repair and replace fixtures. For actual pipe work or sewer issues, you'd need a specialized professional."
  - q: "Do you install ceiling fans and light fixtures?"
    a: "Yes, we install ceiling fans and light fixtures where an electrical box already exists. This includes assembly, mounting, connecting to the existing circuit, and programming remotes. We don't run new circuits—that's a larger project."
  - q: "How quickly can you come to Matthews?"
    a: "We often have same-day or next-day availability in Matthews. For non-urgent repairs, we typically schedule within 2-3 days. Call or text for current availability."
  - q: "What if a repair turns out to be a bigger problem?"
    a: "If a 'quick fix' reveals a larger issue—like a door that needs reframing rather than adjustment—we'll explain what's actually needed and provide a separate quote. You decide whether to proceed. No surprises."

localInfo:
  permits: "Most Quick Fix repairs are maintenance items that don't require permits. Simple fixture replacements and minor repairs fall under normal homeowner maintenance."
  regulations: "We perform all Quick Fix work according to manufacturer specifications and industry best practices."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior Quick Fix repairs don't require HOA approval. Minor exterior items may have community specifications we can follow."
