  neighborhood: "India Hook"
  description: "An upstairs bathroom leak left this India Hook homeowner with a 4-foot section of water-damaged ceiling in the living room below. After the plumber fixed the leak, they called us. We cut out the damaged drywall, ensured the framing was dry and solid, installed new drywall, taped and mudded the seams, and matched the existing knockdown texture. After priming and painting, the repair was invisible. The homeowner said even they couldn't tell where the damage had been."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does drywall repair cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Small repairs (nail holes, door dings) start around $75-150. Medium repairs (fist-sized holes, small water stains) run $150-300. Large repairs (multiple holes, big patches) range from $300-600+. We provide exact quotes after seeing the damage—no surprises."
  - q: "Can you match my textured ceiling?"
    a: "Yes. We match knockdown, orange peel, popcorn, and other textures. Matching texture is more art than science—it takes experience to get it right. We've done enough ceiling repairs in Rock Hill homes to match most common textures seamlessly."
  - q: "My walls keep cracking in the same spots. Can you fix that?"
    a: "Recurring cracks usually indicate movement—settling foundation, seasonal expansion, or framing issues. A simple patch won't solve it. We address the underlying cause (often with flexible tape and compound) or recommend a specialist if the issue is structural. We won't just cover up a problem that will come back."
  - q: "Do you repair drywall after water damage?"
    a: "Yes, once the water source is fixed. We won't patch over active leaks—that leads to mold and bigger problems. Once your plumber or roofer has stopped the water, we cut out damaged drywall, ensure framing is dry, install new drywall, and finish to match your walls."
  - q: "Can you remove popcorn ceilings?"
    a: "Yes. Popcorn ceiling removal is labor-intensive but straightforward. We wet the texture, scrape it off, repair the underlying drywall, and finish smooth or with a new texture. Ceilings in homes built before 1980 may contain asbestos—those require testing before removal."
  - q: "How long does drywall repair take?"
    a: "Small repairs: same-day. Medium repairs: 1-2 days (mud needs to dry between coats). Large repairs or texture matching: 2-3 days. We don't rush drying time—that's how you get cracks and visible patches."

localInfo:
  permits: "Drywall repair typically doesn't require permits in York County unless it's part of a larger renovation project."
  regulations: "Popcorn ceilings in homes built before 1980 may contain asbestos. Testing is required before disturbance. We can coordinate testing or work with your results."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior drywall repairs don't require HOA approval."

### Why Our Repairs Last

**Proper Preparation**: We don't just slap mud over problems. We cut out damaged areas, ensure solid backing, and prep surfaces correctly.

**Quality Materials**: We use setting-type compound for strength and lightweight compound for finishing. Cheap materials mean repairs that fail.

**Patience with Drying**: Each coat of mud needs to dry completely before the next. Rushing this step shows in the finished work.

**Texture Matching**: We take time to match your existing texture. It's the difference between a visible patch and an invisible repair.

### Common Drywall Problems in Rock Hill Homes

**Nail Pops**: Common in newer construction as homes settle. The nail heads push through the drywall surface. We reset nails, add screws, and patch properly.

**Corner Cracks**: Often appear where walls meet ceilings. Usually from seasonal movement. We use flexible tape and techniques that allow for movement.

**Water Stains**: The stain is just the symptom. We need to know the leak is fixed before repairing. Then we seal stains, repair damaged drywall, and paint to match.

**Settling Cracks**: Common in older Downtown Rock Hill homes. Some settling is normal. Large or growing cracks may indicate foundation issues worth investigating.
