  description: "A Skybrook family moved into their new home with a bedroom full of boxed furniture: queen platform bed with storage drawers, two nightstands, a dresser, and a large wardrobe. We assembled everything in one afternoon, secured tall pieces to the wall for safety, and took all the packaging out. The family was able to sleep in their fully furnished bedroom that same night."
