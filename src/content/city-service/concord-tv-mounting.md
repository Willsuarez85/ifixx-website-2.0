  title: "Over-Fireplace Installation in Skybrook"
  neighborhood: "Skybrook"
  description: "A Skybrook homeowner wanted their new 75-inch TV mounted above the fireplace with completely hidden cables. We installed a tilting mount rated for the TV's weight, ran cables through the wall (above the firebox per code), installed a recessed outlet and cable plate behind the TV, and mounted a soundbar below. The result was a clean, professional installation with zero visible wires."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does TV mounting cost in Concord?"
    a: "Basic TV mounting (fixed or tilting mount, mount customer-provided) costs $100-$175. Full-motion mount installation runs $150-$225. Cable concealment adds $100-$200 depending on wall type. Over-fireplace installations with full cable hiding typically run $275-$450 total."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV over my fireplace?"
    a: "Yes, over-fireplace mounting is one of our specialties. We use appropriate tilting mounts for comfortable viewing angles and run cables safely (never through the firebox area). We ensure proper heat clearance and secure mounting into studs or with appropriate anchors."
  - q: "Do you hide the cables in the wall?"
    a: "Absolutely—in-wall cable concealment is available for most installations. We cut small openings behind the TV and near your components, run cables through the wall, and install low-voltage plates for a completely clean look. For fireplaces, we route around the firebox as required by code."
  - q: "What size TVs can you mount?"
    a: "We mount TVs from 32 inches to 100+ inches. Larger TVs require heavier-duty mounts and proper wall support—we assess every installation to ensure safe, secure mounting regardless of TV size."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV on a brick fireplace?"
    a: "Yes, we mount TVs on brick using appropriate masonry anchors. These installations take a bit longer due to drilling but result in very secure mounts. We use proper masonry bits and anchors rated for the TV weight."
  - q: "Do you mount soundbars too?"
    a: "We do. Soundbar mounting is often combined with TV mounting for a complete setup. We can mount soundbars directly below the TV, above a fireplace mantel, or wherever provides the best sound. Soundbar mounting typically adds $50-$100."
  - q: "Do I need to buy the mount or do you provide it?"
    a: "Either way works. If you have a mount, we'll install it. If not, we can recommend and provide quality mounts for your TV size and preferred mounting style (fixed, tilting, or full-motion)."
  - q: "How long does TV mounting take?"
    a: "A basic mount takes 30-60 minutes. With cable concealment, expect 1-2 hours. Over-fireplace installations with full cable hiding take 2-3 hours. We complete most jobs in a single visit."

localInfo:
  permits: "TV mounting doesn't require permits in Concord. Electrical work (adding outlets) may require permits from Cabarrus County if new circuits are involved."
  regulations: "We follow electrical codes for low-voltage cable installation. In-wall cable concealment uses proper low-voltage rated plates and cables."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior TV mounting doesn't require HOA approval. Outdoor TV installations may need review in some communities."

2. **Planning**: Determine optimal mounting height and position

4. **Cable Management**: Conceal cables in wall or via raceway
5. **Testing**: Confirm TV functions, demonstrate mount features if applicable

## Common Mounting Situations in Concord

**New Construction (Christenbury, Skybrook)**: Newer homes often have standard drywall over wood studs—straightforward mounting. We frequently add cable concealment to these "blank slate" walls.

**Fireplace Mounting**: Popular throughout Concord. We ensure proper heat clearance and use tilting mounts for comfortable viewing angles.

**Brick Walls**: Found in many Downtown Concord and Afton Village homes. We use masonry anchors for secure mounting into brick.
