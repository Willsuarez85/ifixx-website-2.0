  neighborhood: "Plaza Midwood"
  description: "The Nguyens' 1940s Plaza Midwood home had original oak hardwoods hidden under layers of carpet and vinyl. We carefully removed the old flooring, repaired damaged boards with matching reclaimed oak, sanded everything down to bare wood, and applied three coats of water-based polyurethane. The result: 1,200 square feet of gorgeous original hardwood brought back to life. The natural warmth of the restored floors transformed the entire home."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does flooring installation cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Flooring costs in Charlotte vary by material: LVP runs $5-$10/sq ft installed, hardwood $8-$15/sq ft, tile $10-$20/sq ft. Refinishing existing hardwood costs $3-$6/sq ft. A typical 1,500 sq ft Charlotte home flooring project ranges from $7,500-$22,000 depending on materials. We provide detailed quotes after measuring your space."
  - q: "What flooring is best for Charlotte's humidity?"
    a: "LVP (Luxury Vinyl Plank) is our top recommendation for moisture-prone areas—it's waterproof and handles humidity swings well. Tile works great in bathrooms and kitchens. Solid hardwood needs proper acclimation and climate control. Engineered hardwood handles humidity better than solid. We help you choose the right material for each room."
  - q: "Can you refinish the original hardwood in my Charlotte home?"
    a: "Absolutely—this is one of our specialties. Many Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, Elizabeth, and Myers Park homes have beautiful original hardwood under carpet or vinyl. We can assess your floors, make repairs with matching wood, and refinish to bring them back to life."
  - q: "How long does flooring installation take?"
    a: "LVP installation for a typical Charlotte home (1,500 sq ft) takes 2-3 days. Hardwood installation takes 3-5 days plus acclimation time. Tile projects run 3-7 days depending on layout complexity. Hardwood refinishing takes 3-5 days with additional dry time before furniture can return."
  - q: "Do I need to acclimate hardwood flooring in Charlotte?"
    a: "Yes, and Charlotte's humidity makes this especially important. Hardwood should acclimate in your home for 5-10 days before installation to prevent gaps or buckling later. We factor this into our project timeline."
  - q: "What about flooring for Charlotte basements?"
    a: "Basements require moisture-resistant options. We recommend LVP or tile for Charlotte basements—never solid hardwood. Proper moisture testing and vapor barriers are essential given our clay soil and humid climate."
  - q: "Can you install tile in my Charlotte bathroom or kitchen?"
    a: "Yes, we install all types of tile: ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone. We handle waterproofing for shower surrounds, heated floor systems, and custom patterns. Charlotte's hard water means we also recommend sealing grout for easier maintenance."
  - q: "Do you repair damaged hardwood floors?"
    a: "We repair scratches, dents, water damage, and worn areas. For historic Charlotte homes, we source reclaimed wood to match original flooring. Sometimes spot repairs and refinishing are more cost-effective than full replacement."

localInfo:
  permits: "Flooring installation in Mecklenburg County typically doesn't require permits unless it's part of a larger renovation involving structural changes. We handle permits when needed for comprehensive projects."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows NC State Building Code. Floor covering fire ratings must meet code requirements for multi-family buildings. Moisture barriers required for slab-on-grade installations."
  hoaConsiderations: "Charlotte condos and townhomes often have HOA requirements for flooring—many require sound underlayment or prohibit certain materials on upper floors. We're familiar with common requirements in SouthPark and Uptown buildings."
