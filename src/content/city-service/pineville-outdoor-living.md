  description: "A Pineville family wanted to transform their plain backyard into an outdoor entertainment destination. We built a 16x20 pergola with electrical for fans and lighting, added a built-in grilling station with counter space and storage, constructed a fire pit seating area with stone surround, and installed outdoor-rated electrical for lighting throughout. The space now hosts everything from family dinners to football parties."

  - q: "How much does a deck cost in Pineville?"

  - q: "How much does a pergola cost?"
    a: "Pergola costs depend on size and materials. A basic 10x10 wood pergola runs $3,000-$5,000. A 12x16 pergola with electrical runs $5,000-$10,000. Vinyl or aluminum pergolas cost more but require less maintenance."
