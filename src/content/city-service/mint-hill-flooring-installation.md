  neighborhood: "Cheval"
  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted to replace their builder-grade carpet with luxury vinyl plank throughout the main level. We removed old carpet and pad, prepared the subfloor, and installed premium LVP with attached underlayment in an open floor plan covering living room, dining room, kitchen, and hallways. New transitions and baseboards completed the look. The result? A cohesive, waterproof floor that's perfect for family life."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does flooring installation cost in Mint Hill?"
    a: "Flooring installation costs in Mint Hill vary by material: carpet runs $3-$6/sq ft installed, LVP costs $5-$9/sq ft installed, hardwood ranges from $8-$15/sq ft installed, and tile costs $10-$18/sq ft installed. These include materials, installation, and basic prep. We provide free in-home estimates."
  - q: "How long does flooring installation take?"
    a: "A typical room takes 1 day for LVP or carpet. A whole-home flooring project (1,500-2,000 sq ft) typically takes 3-5 days. Hardwood and tile take longer due to acclimation and curing times. We work efficiently while maintaining quality."

  - q: "What flooring do you recommend for Mint Hill homes?"
    a: "For most Mint Hill homes, we recommend luxury vinyl plank (LVP) for main living areas—it's waterproof, durable, and looks like hardwood. Tile is great for bathrooms and entryways. Real hardwood adds value if budget allows. We'll help you choose based on your lifestyle and budget."
  - q: "Can you repair hardwood floors in Mint Hill?"
    a: "Yes, we do hardwood repair including board replacement, scratch repair, and refinishing. We can match existing stain colors and patching seamlessly. Repair costs depend on the extent of damage."
