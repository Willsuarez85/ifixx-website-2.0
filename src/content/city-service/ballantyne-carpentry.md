  description: "The Mitchell family wanted to elevate their Providence Plantation home from builder-grade to custom quality. We installed 6-inch crown molding throughout the main level, replaced all baseboards with substantial 5-inch profiles, added decorative door and window casings, built a custom fireplace mantel with craftsman details, and created a built-in entertainment center with display shelving. The transformation brought the interior quality up to match the home's impressive exterior."
