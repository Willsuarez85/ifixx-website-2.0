  neighborhood: "Downtown Matthews"
  description: "This Downtown Matthews homeowner had a 1985 traditional that hadn't been painted in 15 years. The wood siding was chalking and several areas had peeling paint. We pressure washed all surfaces, scraped and sanded problem areas, replaced rotted trim boards, primed bare wood, and applied two coats of premium exterior paint. We also painted the shutters and front door in a complementary accent color. The home now looks fresh and well-maintained—the owners said neighbors have stopped to compliment the transformation."
