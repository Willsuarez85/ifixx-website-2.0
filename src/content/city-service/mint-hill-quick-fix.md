In one half-day visit, we fixed a leaky faucet, rehung a closet door that was off track, installed new door stops throughout the house, tightened loose cabinet hinges, caulked around two bathtubs, replaced smoke detector batteries, and hung three pictures. The result? A to-do list crossed off in a single visit."
