  description: "A homeowner in the historic district wanted to update their 1970s master bathroom while preserving the home's character. We replaced the worn vanity with a custom double-sink unit, installed a walk-in tile shower to replace the old tub-shower combo, added modern fixtures, and upgraded the lighting. The result is a bathroom that feels fresh and modern while complementing the home's traditional architecture."
