  neighborhood: "Johnston Road Corridor"
  description: "A Pineville family upgraded to a 75-inch TV and wanted it mounted above their fireplace with all cables completely hidden. We installed a tilting mount rated for the TV's weight, ran power and HDMI cables through the wall to an outlet behind the TV, and installed an IR extender so remotes work from the cabinet below. The result? A sleek, cable-free look that transforms movie nights."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does TV mounting cost in Pineville?"
    a: "Basic TV mounting in Pineville (TV up to 55\", standard wall, no wire hiding) typically runs $150-$200. Full installation with wire concealment runs $250-$400. Fireplace mounting and complex installations may run $350-$500+. We provide exact pricing based on your setup."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV on any wall?"
    a: "Most walls can support a TV with the right approach. Drywall over studs is ideal—we locate studs and secure the mount properly. For walls without studs in the right location, we use specialty anchors or toggle bolts rated for your TV's weight."
  - q: "Can you hide the TV cables in the wall?"
    a: "Yes, wire concealment is our most popular add-on. We run cables through the wall using proper in-wall rated cables and can add a power outlet behind the TV for a completely cable-free look. This is the professional finish most Pineville homeowners want."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV above a fireplace?"
    a: "Absolutely. We've done many fireplace mounts in Pineville homes. We use tilting mounts so you can angle the TV down for comfortable viewing, and we have solutions for hiding cables on brick and stone surfaces."
  - q: "Do you install soundbars too?"
    a: "Yes, soundbar installation is included or available as an add-on depending on complexity. Simple soundbar mounting runs $50-$75. Sound system setup with multiple speakers is also available."
  - q: "How long does TV mounting take?"
    a: "Basic mounting takes about 1 hour. Mounting with wire concealment takes 1.5-2 hours. Fireplace mounting or complex setups may take 2-3 hours. We schedule appropriately and respect your time."
