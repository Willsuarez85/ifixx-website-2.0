  title: "Whole-Home Trim Upgrade in Stallings"
  neighborhood: "Stallings"
  description: "The Reynolds family loved their Stallings home but felt the builder-grade trim was too basic for their taste. We upgraded the entire main level: installed 5-inch crown molding in every room, replaced thin baseboards with substantial 6-inch profiles, added decorative door casings, and built a custom mantel surround for the fireplace. The transformation elevated the home from builder-basic to custom-quality throughout."
