  neighborhood: "Bain Creek"
  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted to improve their home's curb appeal and security with a new entry door. We removed the old hollow-core door, installed a fiberglass entry door with decorative glass, added new weatherstripping and hardware, and ensured a perfect seal. We also installed a new smart lock for keyless entry. The result? A beautiful, secure entry that transformed the home's appearance."

    a: "Window replacement in Mint Hill typically costs $300-$700 per window installed for standard double-hung vinyl windows. Larger windows, specialty shapes, and premium materials cost more. We can provide a whole-home estimate for multiple windows."
  - q: "Can you fix a door that won't close properly?"
