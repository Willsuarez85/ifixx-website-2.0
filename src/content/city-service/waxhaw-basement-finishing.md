localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does basement finishing cost in Waxhaw?"
    a: "Basement finishing in Waxhaw typically costs $25-$50 per square foot for a basic finish (framing, drywall, flooring, lighting). Adding a bathroom, wet bar, or custom features increases costs. A 1,000 sq ft basement runs $25,000-$50,000+. We provide detailed estimates for your space."
  - q: "How long does basement finishing take?"
    a: "A typical basement finishing project takes 4-8 weeks depending on size and complexity. Adding a bathroom extends the timeline. We provide realistic schedules and keep you updated throughout the project."
  - q: "Do I need a permit to finish my basement in Union County?"
    a: "Yes, basement finishing typically requires permits for framing, electrical, and plumbing work. If you're adding a bedroom, egress windows are required by code. We handle permit applications as part of our service."
  - q: "What flooring is best for basements?"
    a: "Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) is ideal for basements because it's waterproof and handles the moisture common in below-grade spaces. Tile is another excellent option. We avoid carpet directly on concrete due to moisture concerns."
  - q: "Can you add a bathroom to my basement?"
    a: "Yes, we add basement bathrooms. This involves plumbing installation, which may require cutting concrete for drains depending on your home's setup. A basement bathroom adds convenience and value to your finished space."
  - q: "What about moisture and water issues?"
    a: "Moisture is a key consideration for basements. We assess your basement's condition before starting. Minor moisture issues can be addressed with proper insulation and vapor barriers. Significant water problems should be resolved before finishing."
  - q: "Do I need egress windows?"
    a: "If you're creating a bedroom in your basement, building code requires egress windows for emergency exit. We can install egress windows as part of basement finishing, which requires exterior excavation and proper well installation."
  - q: "What can I use a finished basement for?"
    a: "Popular uses include home theaters, recreation rooms, home gyms, guest suites, home offices, playrooms, or additional family living space. We design the space to fit your intended use."

localInfo:
  permits: "Union County requires permits for basement finishing including framing, electrical, and plumbing. Egress windows required for bedrooms. We handle permit applications and inspections."
  regulations: "NC Building Code requires minimum ceiling heights (typically 7'), egress windows for bedrooms, smoke detectors, and proper electrical. We ensure all work meets code."
  hoaConsiderations: "Basement finishing is interior work and typically doesn't require HOA approval. Exterior changes for egress windows may need review in some Union County communities."
