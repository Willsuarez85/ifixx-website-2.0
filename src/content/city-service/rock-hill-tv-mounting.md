  neighborhood: "Fort Mill"
  description: "This Fort Mill family upgraded to a 75-inch TV and wanted it mounted above their fireplace with completely hidden wires. We installed a heavy-duty articulating mount rated for their TV's weight, ran power and HDMI through the wall using a code-compliant recessed outlet box, and concealed all cables. The TV tilts down slightly to reduce glare and neck strain from the higher mounting position. We also programmed their universal remote to control the soundbar. Start to finish: 3 hours. No visible wires, perfect viewing angle."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does TV mounting cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Basic TV mounting (fixed mount, visible cables) starts at $99. Full installation with hidden wires (in-wall cable run) typically runs $200-350 depending on wall type and complexity. Brick or stone mounting adds $50-100. We quote everything upfront after understanding your setup."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV above a fireplace?"
    a: "Yes, we mount TVs above fireplaces regularly. Considerations include heat (most modern gas and electric fireplaces are fine; wood-burning needs assessment), height (may need a tilting mount to reduce neck strain), and hiding wires (usually requires running through the wall or using a cable cover). We assess your specific fireplace and recommend the best approach."
  - q: "Do you provide the TV mount?"
    a: "We can provide mounts at competitive prices, or you can purchase your own. If you buy your own, make sure it's rated for your TV's size and weight (check the specs). We carry several mount options on our truck for same-day installation."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV on brick or stone?"
    a: "Yes. Brick and stone require special anchors and drill bits, which we have. It takes a bit longer and costs a bit more, but the result is rock-solid. Many Lake Wylie and Tega Cay homes have stone accent walls—we mount on these regularly."
  - q: "How do you hide the TV cables?"
    a: "For drywall, we typically run cables through the wall using recessed outlet boxes (code-compliant for power). This gives a completely clean look with no visible wires. For brick, stone, or situations where in-wall isn't possible, we use paintable cable covers that blend with your wall."
  - q: "Can you also set up my streaming devices and soundbar?"
    a: "Yes. We'll connect your Roku, Apple TV, Fire Stick, gaming consoles, and soundbar. Basic programming of universal remotes is included. Full smart home integration is beyond our scope, but we get your entertainment system working and connected."
  - q: "What's the best height to mount a TV?"
    a: "Eye level when seated is ideal—typically 42-48 inches from floor to center of screen for most living rooms. Above fireplaces are higher by necessity, which is why we recommend tilting mounts for those installations. We discuss placement with you before drilling anything."

localInfo:
  permits: "TV mounting doesn't require permits in York County. In-wall power connections must meet electrical code requirements—we use code-compliant recessed outlet boxes."
  regulations: "In-wall power cables require proper rated boxes and wiring. We don't run standard power cords through walls (fire hazard and code violation). Our installations meet code requirements."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior TV mounting doesn't require HOA approval. Exterior mounting (covered patios) may require approval in some Tega Cay and Lake Wylie communities."

*Exact pricing depends on TV size, wall type, and cable concealment method.*

### Wall Types We Mount On

**Drywall**: Most common and straightforward. We locate studs for secure mounting and can run cables through the wall for a completely clean look.

**Brick**: Common in Rock Hill accent walls and fireplaces. Requires masonry anchors for a rock-solid mount. Takes a bit longer but holds securely.

**Stone**: Natural and manufactured stone in Lake Wylie and Tega Cay homes. We use appropriate anchors for the stone type.

**Plaster**: Found in older Downtown Rock Hill homes. Requires different techniques than drywall—we have the experience.

### Fireplace Mounting Considerations

Mounting a TV above a fireplace is popular but requires thought:

- **Heat**: Modern gas and electric fireplaces typically don't generate enough heat to damage TVs. Wood-burning fireplaces need assessment.
- **Height**: Above fireplaces is higher than ideal. We use tilting mounts to angle the TV down for comfortable viewing.
- **Cables**: Usually requires in-wall cable run or cable cover.
- **Mantel**: Depth of mantel affects mount selection.

### Why Professional Mounting Matters

A poorly mounted TV can:
- Fall off the wall (especially with full-motion mounts)
- Look crooked or poorly placed
- Have messy visible cables
- Damage your wall unnecessarily

We measure twice, drill once, and leave you with a TV that's level, secure, and looks like it belongs there.
