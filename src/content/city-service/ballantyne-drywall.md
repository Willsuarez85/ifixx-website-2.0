  description: "A burst pipe in the bonus room above the garage caused significant water damage to the garage ceiling. After the plumber fixed the leak and everything dried out, we cut out the damaged sections (about 40 square feet), installed new drywall, taped, mudded, and matched the existing texture. The homeowner couldn't tell where the damage had been."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Why do my Ballantyne home's walls have so many nail pops?"
    a: "Most Ballantyne homes were built in the 1990s-2010s during rapid development. Fast construction plus the clay soil in this area means houses settle significantly in the first 10-20 years. Nail pops are normal—we fix them all the time. About $50-75 per pop to repair properly."
  - q: "How much does drywall repair cost in Ballantyne?"
    a: "Small holes: $75-150. Medium repairs: $150-300. Large sections or water damage: $300-600+. Ballantyne homes often have 9-10 foot ceilings which can add slightly to the cost for ceiling work. We quote everything upfront."
  - q: "Can you match the texture in my Ballantyne home?"
    a: "Yes. Most Ballantyne homes have either smooth walls (newer construction) or light orange peel texture. We've matched textures in homes throughout Ballantyne, Piper Glen, Providence Plantation, and surrounding neighborhoods. We test-spray before committing."
  - q: "Do you work in Ballantyne HOA communities?"
    a: "Absolutely. Interior drywall work doesn't require HOA approval—it's inside your home. We're familiar with many Ballantyne communities and respect the neighborhood standards when we're working."

localInfo:

## Ballantyne Drywall Repair Services

Ballantyne is one of Charlotte's premier neighborhoods—and we've repaired drywall in homes throughout the area. From starter townhomes to luxury estates, drywall problems don't discriminate. We fix them all with the same attention to detail.

### Common Ballantyne Drywall Issues

**Nail Pops Everywhere**
Ballantyne's rapid development in the 90s and 2000s means many homes are now experiencing settling. Nail pops are the most visible symptom—those little circles or bumps where drywall nails are pushing through. We properly repair nail pops by adding screws for reinforcement, then mud, sand, texture, and prime.

**Water Damage from Upstairs Bathrooms**
Two-story Ballantyne homes frequently develop leaks from master bathrooms above living areas. Once the plumber fixes the source, we handle the drywall repair—cutting out damaged sections, replacing, and matching texture.

**Builder-Grade Drywall Issues**
Fast construction during Ballantyne's building boom sometimes means less-than-perfect drywall work. We fix tape bubbles, bad seams, and other issues that show up years after construction.
