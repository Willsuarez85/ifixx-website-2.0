  neighborhood: "Tega Cay"
  description: "When this Tega Cay homeowner converted a spare bedroom into a home office, they wanted built-in bookshelves and a window seat to maximize the space. We designed and built floor-to-ceiling shelving flanking the window, with a cushioned window seat between them featuring hidden storage underneath. The shelves included adjustable shelving, cable management for electronics, and cabinet doors on the lower sections. Painted to match the existing trim, the built-ins look like they've always been there. The homeowner now has a functional, beautiful workspace."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What kind of carpentry work do you do?"
    a: "We handle finish carpentry (trim, molding, built-ins, shelving), repair carpentry (rotted wood, damaged frames, deck boards), and custom carpentry (window seats, mudroom lockers, closet systems). We don't do structural work like load-bearing walls or foundation repair—that requires specialists."
  - q: "How much does deck repair cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Deck repairs in Rock Hill vary widely. Replacing a few rotted boards runs $200-500. Railing repairs typically cost $300-600. Full deck board replacement (labor only) ranges from $15-25 per square foot. We assess the damage and provide a detailed quote before starting work."
  - q: "Can you match existing trim in older Rock Hill homes?"
    a: "Yes. Downtown Rock Hill and surrounding areas have homes with historic trim profiles that aren't available at Home Depot. We can often find matching profiles at specialty suppliers or create custom trim using a router. Matching existing woodwork is part of our finish carpentry expertise."
  - q: "Do you build custom shelving?"
    a: "Absolutely. From simple utility shelves in garages to full built-in bookshelves with adjustable shelving and integrated lighting, we design and build custom shelving solutions. Built-ins in particular add value and functionality to Rock Hill homes."
  - q: "Can you repair wood rot on my house exterior?"
    a: "Yes. Wood rot repair is common in South Carolina's humid climate. We remove rotted sections, treat remaining wood, and install new material (often composite or treated lumber to prevent future rot). Proper flashing and sealing prevents water from causing the same problem again."
  - q: "What's the difference between a handyman carpenter and a framing contractor?"
    a: "We handle finish and repair carpentry—the detailed work that shows in your home. Framing contractors handle structural work: load-bearing walls, roof framing, floor systems. If your project involves structure (removing walls, adding rooms, foundation work), you need a general contractor. We're great for everything else."
  - q: "Do you install crown molding?"
    a: "Yes. Crown molding installation is one of our specialties. We handle inside corners, outside corners, and the tricky angles that make DIY crown molding frustrating. Typical cost runs $5-12 per linear foot installed, depending on molding size and room complexity."

localInfo:
  permits: "Most carpentry repairs and finish work don't require permits in York County. Building decks or large structures does require permits. We advise on permit requirements for each project."
  regulations: "Deck construction must meet South Carolina Building Code for railings, post spacing, and connections. We build to code even for repairs."
  hoaConsiderations: "Exterior carpentry work (deck repairs, fence modifications) may require HOA approval in Tega Cay, Lake Wylie, and Fort Mill communities. Check before starting visible exterior projects."

### Why South Carolina Climate Matters

Rock Hill's humidity, heat, and occasional storms take a toll on outdoor wood:

- **Decks**: Pressure-treated lumber is essential. Even then, regular maintenance prevents premature rot.
- **Trim**: Exterior trim is constantly exposed to moisture. We use appropriate materials and finishes.
- **Rot Prevention**: We don't just repair rot—we address what caused it (drainage, flashing, ventilation).

We understand the local climate and build accordingly.

### Finish Carpentry Details

The details matter. We:
- Measure precisely for tight joints
- Cope inside corners (not just miter)
- Fill nail holes and sand smooth
- Prime and paint or stain to match
- Clean up completely when done

You shouldn't be able to tell where old work ends and new work begins.

### Custom Built-Ins

Built-ins transform wasted space into functional storage:

- **Home offices**: Bookshelves, desk niches, equipment storage
- **Living rooms**: Media centers, display shelving, window seats
- **Bedrooms**: Closet systems, reading nooks
- **Mudrooms**: Lockers, benches, coat storage
- **Garages**: Workbenches, tool storage, overhead shelving

We design to your space, build to last, and finish to match your home.
