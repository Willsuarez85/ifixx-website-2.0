localIntro: "Ballantyne homes—built during Charlotte's biggest building boom—are now reaching the age where doors stick, locks wear out, and windows need attention. Foundation settling is common in this area's clay soil, and it shows up first in doors that won't close right. We fix doors and windows throughout Ballantyne, from simple hardware replacements to complete door swaps."

  description: "This homeowner's 20-year-old front door had seen better days—the seal was shot, the lock was temperamental, and it didn't match their recently updated exterior. We installed a new pre-hung fiberglass entry door with modern hardware, maintaining the existing opening size. Better security, better insulation, better curb appeal."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Why do doors in Ballantyne homes stick so much?"
    a: "Ballantyne sits on clay soil that expands and contracts with moisture. This causes foundation settling that throws door frames out of square. We can adjust strike plates, shim hinges, or plane doors to compensate. If settling is severe, you might need foundation work first."
  - q: "How much does door repair cost in Ballantyne?"
    a: "Simple adjustments: $75-125. Lock replacement: $100-175. Interior door replacement (pre-hung): $175-300. Front door replacement: $400-800+ depending on the door. We quote everything upfront."
  - q: "Can you replace my builder-grade interior doors?"
    a: "Yes—this is a popular Ballantyne upgrade. Those flat, hollow-core builder doors can be replaced with solid-core or panel doors. We install pre-hung units for the cleanest result. Budget $200-400 per door depending on your selection."
  - q: "My windows are hard to open. Can you fix that?"
    a: "Usually yes. Ballantyne homes from the 90s-2000s have vinyl windows with balance systems that wear out. We can replace window balances in most standard windows for $50-100 per window."

localInfo:
  permits: "Door repair and interior door replacement don't require permits. Exterior door replacement typically doesn't either in Ballantyne."
  regulations: "Exterior doors must meet NC energy code. New doors should have proper weatherstripping and sealing."
  hoaConsiderations: "Some Ballantyne HOAs have guidelines for front door colors and styles. Check your covenants before selecting an exterior door. Interior work doesn't require approval."

## Door and Window Repair in Ballantyne

Ballantyne's beautiful homes are reaching an age where doors and windows need attention. Foundation settling from clay soil, worn hardware after 20+ years, and original windows that don't operate smoothly anymore. We handle it all.

### Common Ballantyne Door & Window Issues

**Settling-Related Door Problems**
Ballantyne's clay soil causes significant settling in homes built during the building boom. Doors that used to close perfectly now rub, stick, or won't latch. We adjust and repair to compensate for settling.

**Worn Window Hardware**
Vinyl windows from the 90s and 2000s have plastic and spring components that wear out. Windows that won't stay open, won't lock properly, or are hard to operate—we can usually repair them.

**Builder-Grade Door Upgrades**
Ready to replace those hollow-core interior doors? We install solid-core and panel door upgrades throughout Ballantyne homes. Pre-hung installation for the best fit and finish.
