  description: "A Wesley Chapel family wanted to convert their dated builder-grade bathroom into a spa-like retreat. We installed a freestanding soaking tub, built a walk-in shower with frameless glass and rainfall showerhead, added dual vanities with quartz countertops, and finished with heated tile floors. The transformation gave them the relaxing space they'd always wanted—without leaving their home."
