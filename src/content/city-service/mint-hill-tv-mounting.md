  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted a complete home theater installation in their bonus room. We mounted a 75-inch TV on a full-motion mount, ran all cables through the wall for a clean look, installed a floating shelf for the soundbar, and mounted surround speakers. We also programmed the universal remote and verified all components worked together. The result? A professional home theater experience without the professional price tag."

    a: "TV mounting in Mint Hill typically costs $150-$250 for standard mounting on drywall with basic cable management. In-wall cable concealment adds $100-$150. Large TVs (75\"+), fireplace mounting, or brick/concrete walls cost more due to additional complexity."

  - q: "What size TV can you mount?"
    a: "We mount TVs of all sizes—from 32-inch bedroom TVs to 90+ inch home theater displays. We have mounts rated for the weight and size of any consumer TV. Larger TVs require more robust mounting solutions."
