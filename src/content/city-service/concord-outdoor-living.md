  neighborhood: "Harrisburg"
  description: "A Harrisburg family had a covered patio they rarely used because of bugs and direct sun. We converted it into a screened porch with aluminum-frame screen panels, a ceiling fan, and exterior-rated flooring. We added a screen door with magnetic closure and exterior lighting. Now they use the space from April through October—morning coffee, evening dinners, and weekend entertaining bug-free."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does deck repair cost in Concord?"
    a: "Deck repair costs depend on scope. Board replacement runs $10-$20 per board. Rail repairs run $15-$30 per linear foot. Complete deck refinishing (cleaning, sanding, staining) costs $3-$6 per square foot. We provide free assessments and quotes for your specific deck."
  - q: "Can you build a new deck?"
    a: "We focus on repairs, refinishing, and smaller outdoor projects. For complete new deck construction, we can recommend trusted deck builders in the Concord area. We're happy to handle the finishing touches once the structure is complete."
  - q: "How much does fence installation cost in Concord?"
    a: "Wood privacy fence installation typically runs $20-$35 per linear foot in Concord. A 150 linear foot backyard fence would cost $3,000-$5,000. Costs vary by fence style, height, and terrain. Gates, post caps, and staining add to the total."
  - q: "Do you install screen porches?"
    a: "We convert existing covered porches and patios into screened enclosures. We install screen frames, screening, doors, and related features. For new covered porch construction, we partner with builders and handle the screening portion."
  - q: "Can you stain or seal my deck?"
    a: "Yes, deck refinishing is a popular service. We clean the deck, make repairs, and apply stain or sealant. Proper maintenance extends deck life significantly. Best done in spring or fall when temperatures are moderate."
  - q: "Do you assemble outdoor structures like pergolas?"
    a: "Yes, we assemble prefabricated pergolas, gazebos, and outdoor structures from stores like Costco, Home Depot, and Wayfair. Assembly typically costs $200-$500 depending on size and complexity."
  - q: "What about outdoor lighting?"
    a: "We install low-voltage landscape lighting, string lights on decks and patios, and motion-sensor security lights. We can also upgrade outdoor fixtures on your home's exterior."
  - q: "Do I need a permit for a fence in Concord?"
    a: "Cabarrus County may require permits for fences over certain heights or in certain locations. Many Concord HOAs also have fence requirements (style, height, placement). We help you understand requirements before installation."

localInfo:
  permits: "Fence permits may be required in Concord depending on height and location—typically required for front yard fences. Deck repairs usually don't need permits; significant structural work may. Check Cabarrus County Building Standards."
  regulations: "Fences typically must be set back from property lines. Height limits vary. Screen porch conversions may have setback requirements."
  hoaConsiderations: "Most Concord HOAs in communities like Christenbury, Skybrook, and Weddington Trace have specific requirements for fences (material, color, style) and outdoor structures. Always check with your HOA before starting."

**Summer**: Good for most projects, though we work early mornings to avoid peak heat.

**Fall**: Best weather for deck refinishing. Lower humidity means better stain absorption.
