  neighborhood: "Afton Village"
  description: "An Afton Village family wanted custom built-in bookshelves for their home office. We designed and built floor-to-ceiling shelving with adjustable shelves, integrated cabinet bases for storage, and crown molding that matched the existing trim. The built-ins were finished with paint-grade wood and a semi-gloss finish to match the room. The project added both function and value to their home."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does crown molding cost in Concord?"
    a: "Crown molding installation in Concord typically costs $4-$8 per linear foot for standard profiles, including material and labor. A typical room runs $300-$600. Complex profiles or high ceilings increase the cost. We provide free estimates for your specific project."
  - q: "Can you match existing trim in my Concord home?"
    a: "Yes, matching existing trim is one of our specialties. We can replicate most standard profiles and match the finish of your existing woodwork. For older or custom profiles, we can have trim milled to match or find the closest standard match."
  - q: "What types of carpentry work do you do?"
    a: "We focus on finish carpentry: trim, molding, built-ins, shelving, door/window casings, wainscoting, and wood repairs. For structural work like framing or deck building, we can recommend trusted specialists in the Concord area."
  - q: "How much do custom built-ins cost?"
    a: "Built-in pricing varies greatly by size and complexity. Simple built-in bookshelves typically start around $1,500-$2,500. Full wall units with cabinets, adjustable shelving, and trim details run $3,000-$8,000+. We provide detailed quotes based on your design."
  - q: "Can you repair wood rot on exterior trim?"
    a: "Absolutely. We repair and replace rotted trim, fascia, soffits, and door jambs. We use rot-resistant materials for replacements and can prime and paint to match existing finishes."
  - q: "Do you install wainscoting?"
    a: "Yes, wainscoting adds elegance to dining rooms, hallways, and bathrooms. We install traditional raised panel, beadboard, and shaker-style wainscoting. Typical costs run $8-$15 per square foot depending on style."
  - q: "How long does trim installation take?"
    a: "A single room with crown molding and baseboard typically takes 1 day. Whole-house trim packages take 3-5 days depending on scope. Built-in projects vary by complexity—typically 2-5 days for custom shelving units."

localInfo:
  permits: "Most carpentry work (trim, built-ins, shelving) doesn't require permits. Structural modifications may require permits from Cabarrus County Building Standards."
  regulations: "We follow building codes for any work that may affect structure or egress. All materials meet applicable fire and safety standards."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior carpentry doesn't require HOA approval. Exterior trim replacement may need to match community standards in some Concord neighborhoods."
