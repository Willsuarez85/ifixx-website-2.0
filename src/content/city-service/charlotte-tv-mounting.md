localIntro: "That TV sitting on a stand is taking up valuable floor space and just waiting for a kid (or a pet, or a clumsy adult) to knock it over. We mount TVs on walls throughout Charlotte—from 32-inch bedroom screens to 85-inch living room monsters. Clean cable management, level mount, and we patch any old holes from previous attempts. Most jobs take about an hour."

  title: "85-Inch TV Over Fireplace"
  neighborhood: "Ballantyne"
  description: "This Ballantyne homeowner wanted their new 85-inch TV mounted above the fireplace with all cables hidden. We installed a heavy-duty articulating mount (this TV weighs over 100 lbs), ran power and HDMI through the wall to an outlet behind the TV, and concealed the soundbar cables. Total time: about 3 hours including wall patching and paint touch-up. Zero visible cables."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does TV mounting cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Basic mount on drywall: $99-149 (you provide the mount). With mount included: $149-249 depending on size. Above fireplace or with full cable concealment: $199-349. We quote everything upfront—no surprise charges. If we find unexpected wall conditions (concrete, metal studs), we'll discuss options before proceeding."
  - q: "Can you mount a TV on a brick fireplace?"
    a: "Yes, but it costs more and takes longer. Brick mounting requires masonry anchors and a hammer drill. Figure $50-75 extra for brick mounting. We're careful to drill into brick (not mortar) for the strongest hold. For Charlotte's gas fireplaces with stone veneer, we can often find wood backing to mount to."
  - q: "Do you hide the cables in the wall?"
    a: "We offer three levels of cable management: (1) Basic cable covers ($25-40) that run down the wall, (2) In-wall cable concealment ($75-125) for HDMI and other low-voltage cables, or (3) Full concealment with in-wall power ($150-200+) so nothing is visible. In-wall power requires running a new outlet behind the TV—we can handle that for existing circuits."
  - q: "What if my wall has metal studs?"
    a: "We run into metal studs occasionally in Charlotte condos and newer townhomes. Metal studs require toggle bolts and sometimes multiple attachment points. We can mount on metal studs, but weight limits are lower—usually max 75 lbs unless we span multiple studs. We'll assess your wall and advise on the best approach."
  - q: "My last TV mount fell off the wall. Can you fix it?"
    a: "We see this more often than you'd think—usually because someone mounted into drywall only, not studs. We'll repair the wall damage, find proper stud locations, and install a mount correctly. If studs aren't where you want the TV, we can use heavy-duty drywall anchors rated for your TV's weight."

localInfo:
  permits: "TV mounting doesn't require permits in Charlotte—it's considered furniture installation, not structural work."
  regulations: "For in-wall power (running a new outlet), North Carolina allows homeowners to do their own electrical work. As contractors, we can install outlets on existing circuits but can't add new circuits. Most TV mounting doesn't require new circuits."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior TV mounting doesn't require HOA approval. Exterior mounting on patios or porches might need approval in some Charlotte communities."

## Professional TV Mounting in Charlotte

There's a reason TV mounting is one of our most popular services—nothing upgrades a living room like a properly mounted TV with clean cable management. We mount TVs throughout Charlotte, from bedroom screens to home theater setups. Level, secure, and looking clean.

### Why Hire a Pro for TV Mounting?

**Finding studs isn't as easy as it sounds.** Charlotte homes have varying wall construction—drywall, plaster, concrete, brick, metal studs. What works in a YouTube video might not work in your home. We've mounted TVs on every wall type Charlotte has to offer.

**Level matters more than you think.** That "close enough" mount will drive you crazy every time you watch TV. We use professional levels and take the time to get it right.

**Cables make or break the look.** A mounted TV with cables dangling down the wall looks worse than a TV on a stand. We offer multiple cable management options to give you that clean, finished look.

### TV Mounting Options

**Fixed Mounts** — $99-149 installed
- TV stays flat against the wall
- Lowest profile (TV sits 1-2" from wall)
- Best for: bedrooms, dens, TVs at eye level

**Tilting Mounts** — $129-179 installed
- TV tilts down up to 15 degrees
- Good for: above fireplaces, high mounting positions

**Full-Motion (Articulating) Mounts** — $179-299 installed
- TV pulls away from wall, swivels, and tilts
- Best for: corner mounting, rooms with multiple viewing angles
- Note: Requires more wall clearance for movement

### Above-Fireplace Mounting

This is our specialty. Charlotte living rooms love the TV-over-fireplace look, but it takes extra planning:

**Heat considerations** — We assess your fireplace type. Wood-burning with heavy heat output? We recommend a mantle to deflect heat. Gas insert that runs occasionally? Usually fine with proper clearance.

**Viewing angle** — TVs above fireplaces are higher than ideal. We recommend tilting mounts to angle the screen down toward your seating position.

**Cable concealment** — Running cables down a fireplace wall is trickier. We can often run through the wall on either side of the fireplace, or use decorative cable covers that match your wall color.

### Cable Management Options

**Option 1: Cable Covers** — $25-40
- Paintable plastic channels that run down the wall
- Good for: renters, brick walls, situations where in-wall isn't possible

**Option 2: In-Wall Low Voltage** — $75-125
- HDMI, component, speaker wire run through the wall
- Power cord still visible (or use a short cable cover)
- Good for: most Charlotte homes with standard drywall

**Option 3: Full Concealment** — $150-200+
- In-wall power kit installed behind the TV
- All cables through the wall
- Zero visible wires
- Good for: clean freaks, home theater setups, above fireplaces

### Charlotte Neighborhoods We Serve

We mount TVs throughout Charlotte: South Charlotte, Ballantyne, Myers Park, Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, NoDa, Cotswold, SouthPark, University City, and beyond. Same-day service often available.

### What to Have Ready

Before we arrive:
- **TV out of the box** with stand attached (so we can test it works)
- **Mount** if you're providing your own (check compatibility with your TV's VESA pattern)
- **Know where you want it** — we're happy to advise on height and location, but it helps if you've thought about it
- **Devices accessible** — if we're connecting a soundbar, cable box, or gaming console, have them ready

Most TV mounting takes 45-90 minutes depending on wall type and cable management options. Ready to get that TV on the wall? Contact us for a free quote.
