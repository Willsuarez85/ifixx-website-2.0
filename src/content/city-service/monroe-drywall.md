localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does drywall repair cost in Monroe?"
    a: "Drywall repair in Monroe depends on the damage extent. Small holes (fist-size or less) typically run $75-$150. Larger patches cost $150-$350. Water damage repairs that require texture matching run $200-$500+. We provide exact pricing after assessing the damage."
  - q: "Can you match my existing wall texture?"
    a: "Yes, texture matching is a specialty. Monroe homes have various textures—orange peel, knockdown, smooth, and popcorn ceilings. We carefully match existing texture so repairs blend invisibly."
  - q: "How long does drywall repair take?"
    a: "Most drywall repairs take 1-2 visits. Small patches can be completed in one visit. Larger repairs or texture matching may require a return visit for final coat and texture application after the first layers dry."
  - q: "Do you handle water-damaged drywall?"
    a: "Yes, water damage repair is a common service. We remove damaged sections, ensure the area is dry and mold-free, install new drywall, and match the existing finish. For active leaks, the source must be repaired first."
  - q: "Can you remove popcorn ceilings?"

  - q: "Do you install new drywall?"
    a: "Yes, we hang and finish new drywall for room additions, basement finishing, and renovations. We handle everything from hanging through final texture and primer."

### Texture Matching Expertise

Monroe homes have various wall textures, and matching them requires skill:

- **Smooth**: Flat finish requiring careful feathering
- **Popcorn**: Acoustic ceiling texture (often removed now)

We carry the tools and materials to match any texture found in Union County homes.

Drywall work creates dust. We minimize the mess:
