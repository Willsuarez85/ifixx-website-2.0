  description: "When the Clarks transitioned to remote work, they ordered an entire home office from Wayfair—two desks, a large bookcase, filing cabinets, and desk chairs. The boxes sat in their South End townhome for two weeks before they called us. Our team arrived at 9 AM, and by 2 PM everything was assembled, arranged according to their layout, and all packaging was removed. The Clarks were taking Zoom calls from their new office by end of day."
