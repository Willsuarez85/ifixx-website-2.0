  description: "New homeowners in Downtown Pineville wanted to make their 1990s home feel fresh and modern. The previous owners had used dark, dated colors throughout. We painted the entire interior—walls, ceilings, trim, and doors—in a modern palette of warm whites and soft grays. The transformation was dramatic: the home went from dark and dated to bright, spacious, and contemporary. Completed in just five days with furniture protection throughout."
