localIntro: "Dead outlets, flickering lights, ceiling fans that wobble—Charlotte homeowners deal with electrical fixture issues every day. We're not electricians (and we won't pretend to be), but we handle the everyday fixes that don't require rewiring: replacing outlets and switches, installing ceiling fans where there's already a box, swapping out light fixtures, and more. Same-day service available, and we clean up when we're done."

  neighborhood: "Dilworth"
  description: "This 1950s Dilworth bungalow had original outlets and switches throughout—the old two-prong outlets and push-button switches. We replaced 24 outlets with modern grounded outlets (where wiring allowed) and 18 switches with modern toggles. The homeowner got a safer, more functional electrical system without a full rewire. Two-day project, minimal disruption."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Are you licensed electricians?"
    a: "No—and we're upfront about that. We handle fixture-level work: replacing outlets, switches, ceiling fans, and light fixtures in existing locations. We don't do panel work, new circuits, or rewiring. For that work, you need a licensed electrician. We're happy to recommend one if your project needs it."
  - q: "Can you install a ceiling fan where there's just a light?"
    a: "If there's already an electrical box rated for a ceiling fan (fan-rated boxes are required), yes. If there's only a light fixture box, a licensed electrician needs to install a fan-rated box first. We can take a look and let you know what you have—many Charlotte homes already have fan-rated boxes from previous installations."
  - q: "How much does outlet replacement cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Standard outlet replacement: $25-40 per outlet (parts + labor). GFCI outlets (for bathrooms/kitchens): $40-60 installed. USB outlets: $50-70 installed. If you're doing multiple outlets, we offer package pricing. We'll quote everything upfront."
  - q: "Can you add outlets to my walls?"
    a: "Adding NEW outlets (running wire to a new location) requires a licensed electrician. We can only replace or upgrade outlets in existing locations. This is a North Carolina licensing requirement—we stay in our lane to keep you safe and legal."
  - q: "Why do my outlets keep going bad?"
    a: "In Charlotte's older homes (especially Dilworth, Myers Park, Elizabeth), we often see worn outlets from decades of use. Outlets that feel loose, don't hold plugs well, or spark when you plug something in should be replaced. In newer homes, outlets can fail from overloading—space heaters and window AC units are common culprits."

localInfo:
  permits: "Fixture replacement work (outlets, switches, ceiling fans in existing boxes) typically doesn't require permits in Mecklenburg County. Adding new circuits or rewiring does require permits and a licensed electrician."
  regulations: "North Carolina requires licensed electricians for any work beyond fixture replacement. We stay within these boundaries—it's the law and it keeps everyone safe."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior electrical fixture work doesn't require HOA approval. External lighting changes might need architectural approval in some South Charlotte communities."

## Charlotte Electrical Fixture Services

Let's be clear: we're not electricians. We're handymen who handle the everyday electrical fixtures that don't require rewiring—and we're really good at it. Outlet replacements, switch upgrades, ceiling fan installations (where there's already a fan-rated box), light fixture swaps. The stuff that keeps your home functioning without calling in the heavy artillery.

### What We Do (And What We Don't)

**We Handle:**
- Replacing outlets (standard, GFCI, USB, smart outlets)
- Replacing switches (toggles, dimmers, smart switches)
- Installing ceiling fans where fan-rated boxes exist
- Swapping light fixtures (chandeliers, pendants, recessed trim)
- Installing smoke detectors and CO alarms
- Replacing doorbell buttons and chimes

**We Don't Do (You Need a Licensed Electrician):**
- Adding new outlets or switches to new locations
- Installing new circuits or upgrading panels
- Any work that involves running new wire
- Outdoor electrical work requiring new wiring
- EV charger installations

### Common Charlotte Electrical Fixture Problems

**Outlets That Don't Work**
- Dead outlets are often on a GFCI circuit—check your bathroom and kitchen outlets for a tripped reset button first
- If the outlet itself is bad, we can replace it in about 15 minutes
- Loose outlets that don't hold plugs are a fire hazard—replace them

**Flickering or Dimming Lights**
- Often just a loose connection at the fixture—easy fix
- Could be a failing switch—we can swap it
- If lights flicker throughout the house, that's a panel issue—call an electrician

**Ceiling Fans**
- Wobbly fans usually just need balancing—we have kits for that
- Fans that don't turn on may need a new pull chain switch or remote receiver
- Installing a new fan where one already existed is straightforward
- No existing fan box? An electrician needs to add one first

**Smart Home Upgrades**
- Smart switches (Lutron, Leviton, etc.) require a neutral wire—most Charlotte homes built after 1980 have them
- Smart outlets are a simple swap
- We can install the hardware; you set up the apps

### Charlotte Neighborhoods We Serve

We handle electrical fixture work throughout Charlotte: South Charlotte, Ballantyne, Myers Park, Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, NoDa, Elizabeth, Cotswold, SouthPark, and University area.

### Our Honest Approach

We could pretend to do electrical work outside our scope—some handymen do. But we've seen the results: house fires, insurance claims denied, code violations when you try to sell. Not worth it.

When you call us for an electrical fixture issue, we'll tell you honestly whether it's something we can handle or if you need a licensed electrician. No ego, no upselling—just honest advice about what your home needs.

### Same-Day Service

Most fixture replacements take 15-30 minutes each. Call us in the morning, and we can usually be there the same day. We keep common outlets, switches, and parts on our truck so there's no waiting for a second visit.

Ready to get those electrical fixtures working? Contact us for a free estimate—or just describe the problem and we'll let you know if we're the right fit.
