  description: "A family relocating to Mint Hill needed help setting up their new home quickly. In one day, we assembled bedroom furniture for three rooms including beds, dressers, and nightstands, built a large entertainment center, assembled a dining table with six chairs, and set up a home office with desk and shelving. Everything was assembled correctly, placed where they wanted it, and all packaging was removed. The result? A fully furnished home ready for move-in day."
