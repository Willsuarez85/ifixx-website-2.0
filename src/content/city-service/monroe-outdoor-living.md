  neighborhood: "Unionville"
  description: "A Unionville family loved their back deck but couldn't enjoy it during mosquito season. We converted their existing deck into an enclosed screen porch with new screens, a ceiling fan, and outdoor-rated lighting. The space is now usable from spring through fall, perfect for family dinners and evening relaxation without the bugs."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does a new deck cost in Monroe?"
    a: "Deck costs in Monroe vary by size and material. Pressure-treated wood decks typically run $25-$40 per square foot installed. Composite decking runs $40-$60+ per square foot. A 300 square foot deck might cost $9,000-$18,000 depending on materials and features. We provide detailed estimates for your specific project."
  - q: "Do you repair existing decks?"
    a: "Yes, deck repair is a specialty. We replace damaged boards, reinforce structural members, fix railings, and address rot. Sometimes targeted repairs can extend a deck's life for years at a fraction of replacement cost."
  - q: "Can you build a screen porch on my existing deck?"
    a: "In most cases, yes. We assess your deck's structure to ensure it can support a roof, then build the screen enclosure. This includes framing, roofing, screens, and often ceiling fans and lighting."
  - q: "What about pergolas and shade structures?"
    a: "We build custom pergolas and shade structures throughout Union County. These add architectural interest and partial shade to your outdoor space. Options include wood and vinyl materials, with or without motorized shade covers."
  - q: "Do you need permits for outdoor construction in Monroe?"
    a: "Union County typically requires permits for decks, screen porches, and permanent structures like gazebos. We handle the permit process and ensure work meets code requirements."
  - q: "Can you build an outdoor kitchen?"
    a: "Yes, outdoor kitchens are a popular addition in Union County. We handle the structure, framing, countertops, and coordination with gas and electrical connections. The result is a functional cooking space for outdoor entertaining."

localInfo:
  permits: "Union County requires permits for decks, porches, and permanent outdoor structures. Height restrictions, setback requirements, and structural standards apply."
  regulations: "Monroe follows NC building code for deck construction, including railing height, spacing, and structural load requirements."
  hoaConsiderations: "Many Monroe subdivisions have specific requirements for outdoor structures including materials, colors, and placement. We recommend checking HOA guidelines before project planning."
