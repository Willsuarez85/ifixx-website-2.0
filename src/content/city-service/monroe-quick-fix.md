localFaqs:

  - q: "Do you bring parts and supplies?"
    a: "We carry common parts like faucet washers, toilet flappers, caulk, touch-up paint supplies, and basic hardware. For specific items (like a particular faucet or fixture), you'll need to provide the part or we can pick it up and add the cost to your bill."

## Why Monroe Homeowners Love Quick Fix Service

### Get It All Done at Once

The beauty of Quick Fix service is tackling multiple items in one visit. Instead of living with that squeaky door for another six months, get it fixed along with the dozen other small things you've been meaning to address.

### Economical Hourly Rates

For small repairs, hourly service is the most economical approach. You pay for the time we're there, not inflated per-item prices. Most customers find that 2-3 hours clears their entire to-do list.

### Professional Results

Even small repairs deserve to be done right. Wobbly towel bars get properly anchored. Caulk lines are clean and consistent. Door adjustments are precise. You get professional quality for every item on your list.
