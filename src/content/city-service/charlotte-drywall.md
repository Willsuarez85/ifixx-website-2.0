We cut out the damaged section, installed new drywall, taped and mudded the seams, matched the existing knockdown texture, and primed everything. The homeowner painted the next day and you'd never know there was damage. Total time: one afternoon."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does drywall repair cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Small holes (doorknob to fist-size): $75-150. Medium repairs (basketball-size or multiple holes): $150-300. Large sections or water damage: $300-600+. Ceiling repairs typically cost 20-30% more due to difficulty. We always quote before we start—no surprises."
  - q: "Can you match my wall texture exactly?"
    a: "Yes—texture matching is one of our specialties. Charlotte homes have every texture imaginable: orange peel (most common in newer homes), knockdown, smooth walls (older homes), skip trowel, and even popcorn ceilings. We bring texture samples and test-spray a small area first. If we can't get a seamless match, we'll tell you before we start."
  - q: "How long until I can paint after a drywall repair?"
    a: "We prime all repairs before we leave, so you can paint as soon as the primer is dry—usually 1-2 hours. For larger repairs that require multiple coats of joint compound, we may need to return the next day for final sanding and priming. We'll let you know the timeline upfront."
  - q: "Do you repair water-damaged drywall?"
    a: "Yes, but ONLY after the water source is fixed. If you have an active leak, you need a plumber first. Once it's dry, we cut out the damaged section, check for mold (if we see mold, you need a remediation specialist), install new drywall, tape, texture, and prime. We've repaired hundreds of water-damaged ceilings and walls across Charlotte."
  - q: "What about the nails popping out of my walls?"
    a: "Nail pops are super common in Charlotte, especially in homes built in the last 20 years—it's just the house settling. We drive the nail back in, add a drywall screw above and below for extra hold, mud over everything, sand, texture match, and prime. Quick fix, usually $50-75 per pop."

localInfo:
  permits: "Drywall repair doesn't require permits in Mecklenburg County. It's considered routine maintenance, not structural work."
  regulations: "For homes built before 1978, we follow EPA lead paint regulations during repairs. Our team is Lead-Safe Certified."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior drywall repairs don't typically require HOA approval. If you're repainting afterward, some South Charlotte HOAs have color restrictions for exterior-visible areas."

## Charlotte's Drywall Repair Experts

After 500+ drywall repairs across the Queen City, our team can handle anything from a simple nail pop to a water-damaged ceiling.

### Common Drywall Problems We Fix in Charlotte

- Moving damage (furniture, appliances)

- Electrical and plumbing access holes
- Anchor holes from wall-mounted TVs or shelves

### Our Texture Matching Process

Getting texture right is what separates a professional repair from an obvious patch. Here's how we do it:

1. **Identify the existing texture** — We examine your walls under raking light to see the exact pattern. Charlotte homes have everything from heavy orange peel to barely-there eggshell.

2. **Test spray** — Before touching your wall, we spray our texture mix on cardboard and compare. We adjust the mix and spray pattern until it matches.

3. **Apply and blend** — We spray slightly beyond the repair area and feather the edges so there's no visible line between old and new texture.

4. **Prime** — Proper primer ensures the repair blends when painted. We use quality primer that seals the repair and provides good paint adhesion.

### What We Don't Do

We're honest about our limits:

- **Structural damage** — If your drywall damage is caused by structural issues (foundation problems, roof leaks), we'll tell you to address that first.
- **Mold remediation** — If we find mold behind your drywall, you need a certified remediation specialist. We can repair the drywall after they're done.
- **Full room installations** — We're repair specialists. For new construction or full room drywall installation, you want a drywall contractor.

### Why Hire Us vs. DIY?

Drywall repair looks easy on YouTube. In reality:

- **Texture matching is hard** — Without experience, your repair will be visible. We've practiced on hundreds of walls.
- **Multiple coats = multiple days** — Proper repairs need 2-3 coats of joint compound with drying time between. Most DIYers try to rush it.
- **Tools matter** — Professional texture sprayers, proper mud consistency, good lighting—these make the difference.
- **We guarantee our work** — If you're not happy, we fix it.

### Charlotte Neighborhoods We Serve
