  neighborhood: "Ballantyne Country Club"
  description: "This Ballantyne Country Club homeowner wanted to transform their dated 2000-era master bath into a spa-like retreat. We removed the old fiberglass shower and garden tub, installing a frameless glass walk-in shower with multiple showerheads and a freestanding soaking tub. We replaced the builder-grade vanity with a custom double vanity featuring quartz countertops and vessel sinks. Heated floors, a makeup vanity area, and designer lighting completed the transformation. The result: a master bathroom worthy of this prestigious community."
