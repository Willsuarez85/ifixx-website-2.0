  title: "Blakeney Water Heater Upgrade"
  neighborhood: "Blakeney"
  description: "This Blakeney homeowner's 15-year-old tank water heater was showing its age—inconsistent temperatures and higher energy bills. We recommended a tankless water heater upgrade for their 4,000 sq ft home. We installed a Rinnai tankless unit with proper venting, upgraded the gas line, and added a water filtration system to protect the unit. The result: endless hot water, lower energy bills, and freed-up garage space where the old tank used to sit."

  - q: "Do you work with the plumbing in Ballantyne's multi-story homes?"
    a: "Yes, many Ballantyne homes are two or three stories with complex plumbing systems. We have experience working on multi-story homes with multiple bathrooms, understanding how to diagnose issues that may affect the whole system and solve problems efficiently."
