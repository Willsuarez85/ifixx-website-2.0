  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted to create the ultimate outdoor entertainment space overlooking the golf course. We built a 400 sq ft composite deck, added a pergola with retractable shade, installed an outdoor ceiling fan, and created a paver patio area for their grill and seating. We also added landscape lighting throughout and low-voltage outlets for entertaining. The result? An outdoor living space perfect for Mint Hill's climate."
