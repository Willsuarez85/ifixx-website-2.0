  neighborhood: "Indian Trail"
  description: "The Martinez family was tired of carpet that showed every stain from their kids and golden retriever. We replaced 1,800 square feet of carpet with waterproof luxury vinyl plank throughout the main level—living room, dining room, kitchen, and hallways. The warm hickory-look LVP brightened the entire floor, made cleaning effortless, and the dog's nails don't leave a scratch. Installation completed in just three days."

localFaqs:
  - q: "What flooring types do you install in Matthews?"
    a: "We install all major flooring types: hardwood (solid and engineered), luxury vinyl plank (LVP), ceramic and porcelain tile, laminate, and carpet. We also refinish existing hardwood floors. We'll help you choose the best option for your home and lifestyle."
  - q: "How much does flooring installation cost in Matthews?"
    a: "Flooring costs in Matthews vary by material. LVP installation runs $4-$8 per square foot. Engineered hardwood is $8-$13 per square foot. Tile ranges from $10-$20 per square foot. We provide detailed estimates based on your specific project and material choices."
  - q: "What flooring is best for families with kids and pets?"
    a: "Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) is the top choice for busy Matthews families. It's waterproof, scratch-resistant, comfortable underfoot, and looks like real hardwood. Spills wipe up easily, pet nails won't damage it, and it's much more forgiving than traditional hardwood."
  - q: "Can you replace carpet with hardwood or LVP?"

  - q: "How long does flooring installation take?"
    a: "Timeline depends on scope. A typical 1,000 sq ft LVP installation takes 2-3 days. Larger projects (1,500-2,000 sq ft) take 3-5 days. Tile installation takes longer due to setting and grouting time. We provide specific timelines during consultation."
  - q: "Do you install flooring on stairs?"
    a: "Yes, we install hardwood treads, LVP with stair nosing, and carpet on stairs. Stairs require special techniques and trim pieces—we handle it all for a seamless look from floor to floor."

localInfo:
