  description: "A Providence Crossing family was tired of their builder-beige walls and wanted a fresh, modern look. We painted the entire main level with carefully selected colors—a warm greige in the open living areas, crisp white trim throughout, and a dramatic navy accent wall in the dining room. The transformation gave their home personality while maintaining a cohesive flow."
