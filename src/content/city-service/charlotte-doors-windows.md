  description: "This Plaza Midwood homeowner came home to find their deadbolt wouldn't turn—they were locked out of their own house. We arrived within an hour, diagnosed the problem (misaligned strike plate from foundation settling), realigned the strike plate, adjusted the door, and tested everything. Total time: 45 minutes. They could lock their door again that night."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Can you fix a door that won't close or latch properly?"
    a: "This is one of our most common repairs in Charlotte. Usually it's a settling issue—the house has shifted slightly and the door no longer aligns with the strike plate. We can adjust the strike plate, shim the hinges, or plane the door to get it closing properly again. If the frame is severely out of square, you might need the frame replaced."
  - q: "Do you replace exterior doors?"
    a: "Yes, but with important caveats. We can replace an existing door in an existing frame (pre-hung door installation). If you need the frame modified, enlarged, or structural work done, that requires a licensed contractor. We're happy to assess your situation and advise honestly."
  - q: "How much does door repair cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Simple adjustments (strike plate, hinge shimming): $75-125. Door lock replacement: $100-175 depending on the lock. Interior door replacement (pre-hung): $175-300 including door. Exterior door replacement: $300-600+ depending on the door. We quote upfront before any work."
  - q: "My windows won't stay open. Can you fix that?"
    a: "Usually yes. Older Charlotte homes have windows with balance systems (springs or weights) that wear out. We can replace window balances in most standard windows for $50-100 per window. If the sash is damaged or the frame is rotted, replacement might be more economical."
  - q: "Can you board up a broken window?"
    a: "Yes—same-day emergency service available. We'll secure the opening with plywood to protect your home until you can get the glass replaced. We don't do glass replacement ourselves, but we can recommend glaziers in Charlotte. Boarding typically costs $75-150 depending on window size."

localInfo:
  permits: "Interior door work doesn't require permits. Exterior door replacement typically doesn't either, but check if you're in a Charlotte historic district—some have design guidelines."
  regulations: "Exterior doors must meet North Carolina building code for egress and security. New exterior doors should have proper weather sealing and meet energy codes."
  hoaConsiderations: "Some Charlotte HOAs have rules about exterior door colors and styles. Check your covenants before choosing a new exterior door. Interior doors are your business."

## Door and Window Repair in Charlotte

Doors that stick. Locks that don't work. Windows that won't stay up. Charlotte homes—old and new—develop door and window problems constantly. Humidity swells wood, foundations settle, and hardware wears out. We fix all of it.

### Common Door Problems We Fix

**Sticking or Rubbing Doors**
This is the #1 door problem we see in Charlotte. Humidity causes wood doors to swell, and settling causes frames to shift. We can:
- Plane the door to fit (removing a thin layer of wood)
- Shim hinges to adjust the door position
- Adjust the strike plate so the latch catches
- Replace weatherstripping to eliminate rub points

**Locks and Hardware**
- Deadbolts that won't turn (usually a strike plate alignment issue)
- Door handles that fall off (loose screws or worn parts)
- Locks that don't latch (worn or damaged mechanisms)
- Complete hardware replacement (new handles, deadbolts, hinges)

**Door Frame Damage**
- Split door frames from forced entry
- Rot on exterior door frames
- Strike plate holes that are too worn to hold screws
- Frames that have shifted out of square

### Common Window Problems We Fix

**Windows That Won't Stay Open**
Older Charlotte homes have double-hung windows with balance systems—either springs or weights and pulleys. When these fail, windows slide shut on their own or won't open at all. We can replace balance systems in most standard windows.

**Windows That Won't Lock**
Window locks wear out over time. We replace lock hardware to restore security. This is especially common on sliding windows and older casement windows.

**Stuck or Painted-Shut Windows**
Previous painters sometimes paint windows shut. We can free them without damaging the frame or sash, then clean up the paint so they operate smoothly.

**Broken Window Cranks**
Casement windows use crank operators that wear out or break. We can replace the crank mechanism to get your window opening and closing again.

### Emergency Door Service

**Can't lock your door?** We offer same-day emergency service for security issues. A door that won't lock is a safety problem—call us and we'll prioritize getting you secure.

**Broken window?** We'll board it up same-day to protect your home until you can get the glass replaced.

### Pet Door Installation

Want a pet door in your existing door? We can install pet doors in interior doors, exterior doors (wood or steel), and sliding glass doors. We'll cut the opening, install the door, and ensure it seals properly.

### Door Replacement (Pre-Hung Doors)

For interior doors, we can replace the entire door and frame as a unit (pre-hung door). This is often easier than trying to fit a slab door to an old, out-of-square frame. We:

- Remove the old door and frame
- Install the new pre-hung unit
- Shim and level for proper operation
- Install hardware (hinges, knob, strike plate)
- Fill nail holes and touch up paint

For exterior doors, we can do the same with pre-hung exterior doors—but only if the rough opening doesn't need modification. Resizing openings requires structural work by a licensed contractor.

### Charlotte Neighborhoods We Serve

We repair doors and windows throughout Charlotte: South Charlotte, Ballantyne, Myers Park, Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, NoDa, Elizabeth, Cotswold, SouthPark, and University area.

### What We Don't Do

**Glass replacement** — We fix window hardware and frames, but we don't replace broken glass. We can board up broken windows and recommend glaziers.

**Window installation** — New window installation (replacement windows) is specialized work. We focus on repairing existing windows.

**Structural frame modifications** — If you need to enlarge a doorway or window opening, that's contractor territory.
