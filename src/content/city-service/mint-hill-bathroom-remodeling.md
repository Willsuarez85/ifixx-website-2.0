  description: "A Mint Hill family wanted to transform their cramped 1990s master bathroom into a spa-like retreat. We removed the dated garden tub, installed a spacious walk-in shower with frameless glass, added a double vanity with quartz countertops, and upgraded to modern tile flooring. New LED lighting and a fresh coat of paint completed the transformation. The result? A modern bathroom that added significant value to their home."
