localIntro: "Charlotte homes showcase a century of craftsmanship—from the intricate millwork in Dilworth's bungalows to the clean lines of modern Ballantyne construction. Our carpentry team has worked on trim, built-ins, and custom woodwork across the Queen City, understanding both the traditional styles that define our historic neighborhoods and the contemporary looks popular in newer communities. Whether you need crown molding installed in Myers Park, a custom entertainment center in NoDa, or deck repairs in Plaza Midwood, we bring skilled craftsmanship to every project."

  neighborhood: "Dilworth"
  description: "The Petersons' 1923 Dilworth bungalow had beautiful original woodwork throughout—except for the living room, which was missing the built-in bookcases common in craftsman homes of that era. We designed and built floor-to-ceiling bookcases flanking the fireplace, matching the home's original trim profiles, wood species, and stain color. The project included integrated lighting and adjustable shelving. The result looks like it's been there for 100 years."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does custom carpentry cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Charlotte carpentry costs vary by project complexity. Trim installation runs $3-$8 per linear foot. Crown molding averages $8-$15 per linear foot installed. Custom built-ins start around $2,000-$5,000 for simple designs and go up to $15,000+ for full wall units with premium finishes. We provide detailed quotes after seeing your space."
  - q: "Can you match the original trim in my Charlotte historic home?"
    a: "Yes, this is one of our specialties. We work with local millwork shops to replicate original profiles found in Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, Elizabeth, and Myers Park homes. We can match wood species, profile shapes, and finish styles to ensure new work blends seamlessly with original craftsmanship."
  - q: "Do you build custom cabinets and built-ins?"
    a: "We build custom entertainment centers, bookcases, window seats, mudroom storage, closet systems, and more. We work with you on design, material selection, and finish options. Each piece is custom-built for your space."
  - q: "How long does a trim installation project take?"
    a: "Crown molding for an average Charlotte home (1,500-2,500 sq ft) takes 2-3 days. Full trim packages (baseboards, crown, door casings) run 3-5 days. Custom built-ins depend on complexity—simple bookcases take a week, elaborate entertainment centers may take 2-3 weeks."
  - q: "Do you do deck building and repair?"
    a: "Yes, we build new decks and repair existing ones. Charlotte's humid climate is tough on outdoor wood—we see a lot of deck repairs in older neighborhoods. We work with pressure-treated lumber, composite decking, and premium hardwoods depending on your budget and preferences."
  - q: "What about door and window trim?"
    a: "We install and replace interior door casings, window trim, and exterior trim. If you're updating your Charlotte home's look—switching from builder-grade to craftsman-style trim, for example—we can transform the feel of your space without major renovation."
  - q: "Do you install wainscoting and shiplap?"
    a: "Yes, wainscoting, beadboard, shiplap, and board-and-batten are all in our wheelhouse. These treatments are popular in Charlotte homes—wainscoting in dining rooms and hallways, shiplap accent walls in bedrooms and living areas."
  - q: "Can you repair damaged wood trim and millwork?"
    a: "Absolutely. We repair rotted exterior trim, damaged baseboards, broken window sills, and worn stair railings. When possible, we repair rather than replace to maintain original character in historic Charlotte homes."

localInfo:
  permits: "Most interior carpentry work in Mecklenburg County doesn't require permits. Deck construction over 30 inches high requires permits. We handle permit applications when needed."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows NC State Building Code. Deck railings required for surfaces more than 30 inches above grade. Stair railings have specific height and baluster spacing requirements."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior carpentry rarely requires HOA approval. Exterior work like decks may require architectural review in Charlotte communities with active HOAs, especially in Ballantyne and SouthPark areas."
