  title: "Whole-House LVP Installation in Fort Mill"
  neighborhood: "Fort Mill"
  description: "This Fort Mill family was replacing carpet throughout their 2,400 sq ft home with luxury vinyl plank flooring. They wanted the waterproof durability of LVP with a realistic wood look. We removed all existing carpet and pad, prepped the subfloor (leveling compound where needed), and installed LVP throughout the main level and upstairs. We added transitions at bathrooms and closets, quarter-round at baseboards, and stair nosing for the three steps to the sunken living room. The project took four days, and the homeowners stayed in the house the entire time—minimal disruption, maximum impact."

localFaqs:
  - q: "How much does flooring installation cost in Rock Hill?"
    a: "Flooring installation costs in Rock Hill typically run $3-6 per square foot for labor (LVP and laminate), $5-10 per square foot for hardwood installation, and $8-15 per square foot for tile (more for complex patterns). Materials are additional. A typical 300 sq ft room costs $900-$1,800 for LVP install. We provide exact quotes after measuring your space."
  - q: "Do you remove old flooring?"
    a: "Yes. We remove carpet, vinyl, laminate, and tile. Carpet removal is typically included in our installation pricing. Tile removal is additional due to the labor involved ($2-4 per square foot). We haul away debris and leave your space clean."
  - q: "Can you install flooring I've already purchased?"
    a: "Absolutely. Many Rock Hill homeowners buy flooring from Floor & Decor, Lowe's, or elsewhere and hire us to install. Just make sure you order 10% extra for waste and cuts. We can also source flooring at competitive prices if you prefer one-stop shopping."
  - q: "How long does flooring installation take?"
    a: "LVP/laminate installation averages 100-200 sq ft per hour once we're rolling. A typical 1,500 sq ft home takes 2-4 days including prep and finishing. Hardwood and tile take longer due to drying/acclimation time. We provide a realistic timeline based on your specific project."
  - q: "Do you do stairs?"
    a: "Yes. Stair installation requires stair nosing, careful cutting, and proper technique. We install LVP, hardwood, and carpet on stairs. Stairs are typically priced per step ($35-75 each) due to the additional labor involved."
  - q: "What about transitions between rooms?"
    a: "Transitions between flooring types (tile to LVP, carpet to hardwood) require proper transition strips for a clean look and safe walking surface. We include appropriate transitions in our quotes and ensure they're level and properly anchored."
  - q: "Is LVP really better than laminate?"
    a: "For most Rock Hill homeowners, yes. LVP is waterproof (laminate isn't), more durable underfoot, quieter with the right underlayment, and often more realistic looking. The price difference is minimal these days. LVP is especially smart for homes with kids, pets, or high humidity (Lake Wylie lakefront properties)."
  - q: "Can you refinish existing hardwood floors?"
    a: "Yes. Hardwood refinishing involves sanding, staining (optional), and applying new finish. It's significantly cheaper than replacement and gives old floors new life. Not all hardwoods can be refinished—we assess floor condition and advise accordingly."

localInfo:
  permits: "Flooring installation typically doesn't require permits in York County."
  regulations: "Flooring in some applications (commercial, multi-family) must meet fire rating requirements. Residential flooring is generally unrestricted."
  hoaConsiderations: "Interior flooring changes don't require HOA approval. Some condo associations have noise requirements for flooring above ground-floor units—we can advise on appropriate underlayment."

### Why Installation Quality Matters

Flooring is only as good as its installation. We:

- **Prep Subfloors Properly**: Leveling compound where needed, proper underlayment, clean surfaces
- **Acclimate Materials**: Hardwood especially needs time to adjust to your home's humidity
- **Plan Layout**: Boards are staggered properly, not in obvious patterns
- **Handle Transitions**: Clean transitions between rooms and flooring types
- **Finish Details**: Quarter-round, baseboards reinstalled, thresholds properly fitted

### LVP: Our Recommendation for Most Rock Hill Homes

Luxury vinyl plank has become the go-to flooring for good reason:

- **Waterproof**: Essential for kitchens, bathrooms, and lakefront homes with humidity
- **Durable**: Handles kids, pets, and daily life
- **Realistic**: Modern LVP looks remarkably like real wood
- **Comfortable**: Warmer underfoot than tile, softer than hardwood
- **Affordable**: Great value for the performance

We install all flooring types, but when clients ask our recommendation, LVP wins for most applications.
