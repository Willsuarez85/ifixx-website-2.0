  neighborhood: "Lake Wylie"
  description: "A Lake Wylie homeowner's 15-year-old deck was showing its age—faded boards, wobbly railings, and a few soft spots. We replaced damaged joists and decking boards, installed new composite railing with cable inserts for unobstructed lake views, power washed and stained the remaining structure, and added low-voltage deck lighting. The result? A safe, beautiful deck ready for another 15 years of lakeside entertaining."
