  title: "Myers Park Kitchen Transformation"
  neighborhood: "Myers Park"
  description: "When the Hendersons bought their 1960s Myers Park colonial, they inherited a cramped galley kitchen that hadn't been updated in 30 years. We opened up the space by removing a non-load-bearing wall, installed custom shaker cabinets, added a large island with seating for four, and upgraded to quartz countertops. The project included new LED under-cabinet lighting and a tile backsplash that complements the home's traditional architecture. The result? A modern kitchen that still feels at home in this classic neighborhood."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Do I need a permit for kitchen remodeling in Charlotte?"
    a: "In Mecklenburg County, permits are typically required when you're moving plumbing, adding electrical circuits, or making structural changes like removing walls. Simple cosmetic updates like replacing cabinets or countertops usually don't require permits. We handle the permit process for projects that need them—it's built into our service."
  - q: "How long does a typical Charlotte kitchen remodel take?"
    a: "For a full kitchen renovation in Charlotte, expect 4-8 weeks depending on scope. We've found that material lead times can vary—custom cabinets typically take 4-6 weeks, while stock options are faster. We coordinate with trusted Charlotte suppliers to minimize delays and keep your project on schedule."
  - q: "Can you work with the older plumbing in Charlotte's historic homes?"
    a: "Absolutely. We've worked extensively in neighborhoods like Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, and Elizabeth where homes have original plumbing. We know what to expect with galvanized pipes, cast iron drains, and the unique challenges of 100-year-old construction. Our team takes extra care with historic properties to preserve their character while bringing them up to modern standards."
  - q: "Do you handle kitchen remodeling in Charlotte condos and townhomes?"
    a: "Yes, we work with many condo and townhome owners in SouthPark, Uptown, and South End. We're familiar with the HOA approval processes and noise/work hour restrictions common in these communities. We coordinate with building management to ensure smooth project execution."

localInfo:
