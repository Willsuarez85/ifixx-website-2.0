  description: "A Fairview family wanted to update their entire home's interior after living with builder beige for ten years. We painted all common areas, four bedrooms, and three bathrooms with carefully selected colors that flow from room to room. Proper prep work including patching nail holes, caulking gaps, and priming dark accent walls ensured a flawless finish. The transformation was dramatic—same furniture, completely different feel."
