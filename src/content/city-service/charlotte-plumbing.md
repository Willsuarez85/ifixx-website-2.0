localIntro: "Charlotte plumbing is as varied as its neighborhoods. Dilworth homes from the 1920s still run on original galvanized pipes. Myers Park colonials have a mix of copper and plastic from multiple renovations. And South Charlotte new construction uses all PEX. After 300+ plumbing jobs across the Queen City, our team knows what to expect when we walk through your door—and how to fix it right the first time."

  neighborhood: "Plaza Midwood"
  description: "This 1945 Plaza Midwood craftsman had its original galvanized water lines—corroded to the point where water pressure had dropped to a trickle. We replaced all supply lines with PEX, updated the main shut-off valve, and installed new hose bibs. The project took 3 days with minimal wall damage. The homeowners went from barely filling a bathtub to full pressure throughout the house."

localFaqs:
  - q: "Do Charlotte's older homes have plumbing problems?"
    a: "Many do. Homes built before 1970 often have galvanized steel pipes that corrode from the inside, reducing water pressure and eventually leaking. We see this constantly in Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, Myers Park, and Elizabeth. The good news is that repiping technology has come a long way—we can replace your pipes with minimal wall damage and disruption."
  - q: "What causes low water pressure in Charlotte homes?"
    a: "The most common causes we see in Charlotte are corroded galvanized pipes (especially in older neighborhoods), mineral buildup from Charlotte's hard water, failing pressure regulators, and partially closed shut-off valves. We diagnose the exact cause before recommending solutions—sometimes it's a simple fix, sometimes repiping makes more sense long-term."
  - q: "Do you handle emergency plumbing in Charlotte?"
    a: "Yes, we offer same-day emergency plumbing service throughout the Charlotte metro area. Water leaks, burst pipes, and backed-up drains can't wait. Call us directly—you'll talk to a real person who can dispatch help quickly. We serve Charlotte, South Charlotte, Ballantyne, and surrounding areas."
  - q: "Is Charlotte water hard? Do I need a water softener?"
    a: "Charlotte-Mecklenburg water is moderately hard, which can cause mineral buildup in pipes and fixtures over time. Whether you need a water softener depends on your specific situation—we can test your water and make an honest recommendation. Some Charlotte homeowners benefit from whole-house filtration or softening; others do fine with periodic maintenance."

localInfo:
  permits: "Mecklenburg County requires permits for new plumbing installations, repiping, water heater installations, and major repairs. We handle permit applications and coordinate inspections. Typical turnaround is 5-7 business days."
  regulations: "Charlotte follows NC Plumbing Code. Backflow prevention required on irrigation systems. Water heater installations must meet current energy codes. All supply line work requires inspection before wall closure."
  hoaConsiderations: "Some Charlotte HOAs require notification for exterior plumbing work or water heater replacements. Condo buildings often have shared plumbing stacks—we coordinate with building management when needed."
