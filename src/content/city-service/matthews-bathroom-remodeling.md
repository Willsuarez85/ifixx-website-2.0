  neighborhood: "McKee Farms"
  description: "This McKee Farms couple wanted to update their 2005 master bathroom before their daughter's wedding—the house would be full of guests. We replaced the old fiberglass shower with a tiled walk-in shower, installed a new vanity with double sinks, added new lighting and mirrors, and replaced the flooring. We completed the project two weeks before the wedding, and the homeowners were thrilled with their updated space. The bathroom went from dated builder-grade to a comfortable retreat."
