You walk into your kitchen and there's water dripping from the ceiling. Or you come home to find your bathroom flooded. Your heart sinks.

Water damage is one of the most stressful things a homeowner can face. But what you do in the first 24-48 hours makes a huge difference in how much damage occurs — and how much the repair costs.

We're Jaime and Hamed from iFIXX, and we repair water damage in Charlotte homes every week. Here's exactly what to do (and what NOT to do) when water damage happens to you.

## Step 1: Stop the Water Source (If You Can)

Before anything else, stop the water from flowing.

**If it's a burst pipe or major leak:**
- Turn off your home's main water shutoff valve
- Usually located near the water meter, in the garage, or basement
- Turn clockwise to close

**If it's a toilet overflow:**
- Turn the shutoff valve behind the toilet clockwise
- Don't flush again

**If it's an appliance (washing machine, dishwasher):**
- Turn off the appliance
- Shut the supply valves behind it

**If it's coming from above (upstairs neighbor, roof):**
- You can't stop it from your end
- Call the neighbor or your landlord immediately
- For roof leaks, place buckets and call a roofer

**Can't find the source?** Call a plumber. Don't wait.

## Step 2: Document Everything (For Insurance)

Before you clean up anything, take photos and videos:

- Wide shots of the affected area
- Close-ups of the water source
- Any damaged items (furniture, electronics, belongings)
- Water lines on walls showing how high it got
- Timestamps matter — your phone records when photos were taken

This documentation is crucial if you file an insurance claim.

## Step 3: Remove Standing Water

The longer water sits, the worse the damage gets.

**For small amounts:**
- Towels and mops work fine
- Wet/dry shop vac if you have one

**For significant flooding:**
- Rent a pump or wet vac from Home Depot
- Or call a water extraction service

**Important:** If the water is contaminated (sewage backup, flood water from outside), don't touch it. Call a professional remediation company.

## Step 4: Start Drying Immediately

Mold can start growing in 24-48 hours. You need airflow.

**Do this now:**
- Open windows (if weather permits)
- Run fans — aim them at wet areas
- Run your AC or dehumidifier
- Pull furniture away from wet walls
- Remove wet rugs and items to dry elsewhere

**For carpet:**
- Pull it back to dry the pad underneath
- The pad usually needs to be replaced; carpet sometimes can be saved

**Pro tip:** Rent industrial fans and dehumidifiers from Home Depot. They're way more powerful than household fans.

## Step 5: Identify What's Damaged

Not everything needs to be replaced. Here's a quick guide:

**Usually salvageable:**
- Drywall that dried within 24-48 hours (if no mold)
- Hardwood floors (if dried quickly)
- Most furniture (if dried quickly)
- Solid wood items

**Usually needs replacement:**
- Drywall that stayed wet more than 48 hours
- Carpet padding (almost always)
- Particleboard furniture (swells and falls apart)
- Insulation that got wet
- Ceiling tiles

**Might need professional assessment:**
- Subfloor under tile or carpet
- Walls that were wet for unknown duration
- Anything with visible mold

## Step 6: Call the Right People

Here's where homeowners often get confused. Different problems need different pros:

**Call a PLUMBER if:**
- Pipe burst inside a wall
- Main water line issue
- Sewer backup
- Water heater leak/replacement

**Call a HANDYMAN (like us) if:**
- You need drywall repair
- Ceiling repair and painting
- Baseboard replacement
- Texture matching
- General cleanup and restoration

**Call a RESTORATION COMPANY if:**
- Major flooding (whole rooms)
- Sewage or contaminated water
- Mold is already visible
- You want to bill insurance directly

**Call a ROOFER if:**
- Water is coming from above during rain
- Ceiling leak with no plumbing above it

## Step 7: Prevent Mold

Mold is the real danger with water damage. It can cause health issues and make repairs much more expensive.

**Signs of mold starting:**
- Musty smell
- Discoloration on walls (black, green, white spots)
- Allergic reactions (sneezing, itchy eyes)

**To prevent mold:**
- Keep airflow going for several days
- Run dehumidifier continuously
- Don't seal up walls until everything is completely dry
- Consider antimicrobial spray on affected areas

**If you already see mold:** Small areas (less than 10 sq ft) you might handle yourself with proper protection. Larger areas need professional mold remediation.

## The First 48 Hours Are Critical

Here's the timeline of water damage:

- **Within minutes:** Water spreads to surrounding materials
- **Within hours:** Drywall, carpet, and furniture start absorbing water
- **24-48 hours:** Mold and mildew begin growing
- **1 week:** Mold spreads; structural damage possible
- **2+ weeks:** Major mold infestation; extensive repairs needed

The faster you act, the less it costs to fix.

## What Does Water Damage Repair Cost in Charlotte?

We get asked this a lot. Here are typical ranges:

| Repair Type | Typical Cost |
|-------------|--------------|
| Small ceiling patch (< 2 sq ft) | $150-300 |
| Medium drywall repair (2-10 sq ft) | $300-600 |
| Large section replacement | $600-1,500+ |
| Full room (walls + ceiling) | $1,500-3,000+ |
| Painting after repair | +$200-500 |

**Note:** These are repair costs after the water source is fixed. Plumber costs are separate.

## Should You File an Insurance Claim?

It depends on:

- **Your deductible** — If repairs cost less than your deductible, don't file
- **The cause** — Sudden accidents are usually covered; gradual leaks often aren't
- **The amount** — Small claims can raise your premiums

**Usually covered:**
- Burst pipes
- Accidental appliance overflow
- Storm damage (check your policy)

**Usually NOT covered:**
- Gradual leaks you ignored
- Flood water from outside (requires separate flood insurance)
- Negligence or lack of maintenance

When in doubt, call your insurance company and ask — you can ask questions without filing a claim.
