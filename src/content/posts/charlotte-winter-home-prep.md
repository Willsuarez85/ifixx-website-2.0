Charlotte winters are unpredictable. One week it's 60 degrees and sunny. The next, there's an ice storm that knocks out power for three days.

Most years, we get a few hard freezes—cold enough to burst pipes if you're not prepared, but not cold enough that everyone automatically knows what to do. That's when homes get damaged: when the cold catches people off guard.

This checklist covers what Charlotte homeowners actually need to do before winter hits. Nothing excessive, nothing you don't need here. Just the stuff that prevents expensive problems.

## Protect Your Pipes (The Big One)

Frozen pipes cause more winter damage in Charlotte than almost anything else. When water freezes inside a pipe, it expands. If there's no room to expand, the pipe cracks or bursts. When it thaws, you get flooding.

**Exterior faucets and hose bibs:**
- Disconnect all garden hoses (water left in the hose can freeze back into the faucet)
- If you have shut-off valves for outdoor faucets, close them and drain the line
- Install insulated faucet covers on all outdoor spigots ($3-5 at any hardware store)

**Pipes in vulnerable areas:**
- Crawl spaces, garages, and unheated areas are highest risk
- Insulate exposed pipes with foam pipe sleeves
- Seal any gaps or cracks in crawl space vents that let cold air in

**During freezing weather:**
- Open cabinet doors under sinks on exterior walls to let warm air circulate
- Let faucets drip slightly during hard freezes (moving water is harder to freeze)
- Know where your main water shut-off is in case a pipe does burst

**Crawl spaces matter:** Many Charlotte homes have crawl space foundations, and that's where a lot of plumbing runs. If your crawl space vents are open and the temperature drops into the teens, those pipes are at risk. Consider closing vents or adding insulation before winter.

## Check Your Heating System

Your furnace or heat pump has probably been sitting idle since March. Before you really need it, make sure it works.

**Basic checks you can do:**
- Replace your air filter (you should be doing this every 1-3 months anyway)
- Turn on the heat and let it run for 30 minutes—listen for unusual sounds
- Check that all vents are open and unblocked by furniture or rugs
- Test your thermostat to make sure it's responding correctly

**What the pros check:**
- Heat exchanger for cracks (carbon monoxide risk)
- Electrical connections and safety controls
- Refrigerant levels (heat pumps)
- Gas connections and burner function

**Heat pump owners:** Charlotte's climate is perfect for heat pumps most of the year, but they lose efficiency below 35-40°F. When it gets into the 20s, your system switches to auxiliary (electric) heat, which costs significantly more. This is normal, but if you notice it running aux heat when it's 45 degrees out, something's wrong.

## Seal Drafts and Air Leaks

You're not trying to heat the outdoors. But if your home has gaps and cracks, that's essentially what you're doing.

**Check these common spots:**
- Weatherstripping around exterior doors (close the door on a piece of paper—if it slides out easily, the seal is worn)
- Windows, especially older single-pane windows
- Where pipes and wires enter your home
- Electrical outlets on exterior walls (you can feel cold air coming through)
- Attic access doors or pull-down stairs

**Quick fixes:**
- Replace worn weatherstripping ($10-20 per door)
- Apply window film or shrink-wrap on drafty windows
- Use foam gaskets behind outlet covers on exterior walls
- Caulk gaps around window frames

**The attic matters most:** Heat rises. If your attic isn't properly insulated or has gaps around penetrations, you're losing a huge amount of heat (and money). While you're up there, check that insulation isn't blocking soffit vents—you need airflow to prevent moisture problems.

## Gutters and Drainage

Ice dams form when heat escapes through your roof, melts snow, and the water refreezes at the cold eaves. The ice backs up under shingles and causes leaks.

Charlotte doesn't get heavy snow often, but ice storms can create similar problems.

**Before winter:**
- Clean out all gutters and downspouts (leaves from fall are the main culprit)
- Check that downspouts direct water away from your foundation
- Repair any sagging or damaged gutter sections
- Make sure the ground slopes away from your home

**During ice events:**
- Never try to chip ice off your gutters or roof—you'll cause damage
- If ice dams form and you see water inside, catch it with buckets and call for help
- Keep pathways clear of ice for safety

## Exterior Prep

**Outdoor furniture and equipment:**
- Store or cover patio furniture, grills, and outdoor cushions
- Drain and store garden hoses
- Winterize your lawn mower (drain fuel or add stabilizer)
- Bring in anything that could blow around or get damaged by ice

**Trees and landscaping:**
- Trim dead branches that could fall on your home or power lines
- Remove any limbs hanging over your roof
- Note any large trees that look unhealthy—ice loading can bring them down

**Your deck:**
- Check for loose boards or nails that could become hazards when icy
- Clear leaves and debris that trap moisture against the wood
- If you haven't sealed your deck recently, water can get into cracks and cause freeze damage

## Emergency Prep

Power outages happen during winter storms. Be ready.

**Have on hand:**
- Flashlights and fresh batteries
- Phone chargers (battery pack or car charger)
- Bottled water (if your water comes from a well, no power means no water)
- Non-perishable food that doesn't require cooking
- Extra blankets or sleeping bags
- First aid kit

**Heating backup:**
- If you have a fireplace, make sure the chimney is clean and the damper works
- Space heaters are fine for supplemental heat, but never leave them unattended and keep them away from anything flammable
- Never use outdoor heaters, grills, or generators inside—carbon monoxide kills

**Protect your pipes during outages:**
- If power goes out and temperatures are below freezing, open faucets to a slow drip
- If you leave the house, don't set the thermostat below 55°F
- Know how to shut off your water main in case of a burst pipe

## When to Get Help

Most of this checklist is stuff you can handle on a Saturday afternoon. But some things are worth having a professional check:

- Heating system tune-ups (especially if your system is over 10 years old)
- Insulating crawl spaces with plumbing
- Sealing and insulating attics properly
- Anything involving your roof

If you're not sure whether your home is ready for winter—or if you've got an older Charlotte home with a crawl space and exposed pipes—we're happy to take a look and let you know what actually needs attention.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I start winter prep in Charlotte?

Mid-November is ideal. That gives you time before the first freeze (usually late November or December) and before the holiday rush makes scheduling harder. But honestly, if it's January and you haven't done anything yet, it's still worth doing—our coldest weather is usually in January and February.

### Do I really need to drip my faucets during a freeze?

If temperatures drop below 28°F for several hours and you have pipes in exterior walls or unheated spaces, yes. The trickle doesn't need to be much—just enough to keep water moving. It'll add a few dollars to your water bill, but that's a lot cheaper than a burst pipe.

### How cold does it have to get for pipes to freeze?

Pipes are at risk when outside temperatures stay below 32°F for several hours, but the real danger zone is below 20°F. Pipes in unheated spaces or against exterior walls can freeze even when the rest of your house is warm. The key is how cold it gets where the pipes are, not just what the thermometer says outside.
