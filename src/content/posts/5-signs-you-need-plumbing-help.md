Every homeowner deals with plumbing issues at some point. But how do you know when a problem is a simple DIY fix versus when you need to call in the professionals?

## 1. Consistently Slow Drains

A single slow drain might just need some cleaning, but if multiple drains in your home are slow, you could have a main line issue that needs professional attention.

## 2. Unexplained Water Bill Increases

If your water usage hasn't changed but your bill keeps climbing, you likely have a hidden leak somewhere. A professional can perform leak detection to find the source.

## 3. Low Water Pressure Throughout the House

Low pressure in one faucet might just be a clogged aerator. But if pressure is low everywhere, it could indicate a more serious problem with your main water line or pipes.

## 4. Strange Sounds in Your Pipes

Banging, whistling, or gurgling sounds coming from your pipes aren't normal. These sounds can indicate air in the lines, loose pipes, or drain problems.

## 5. Visible Water Damage or Mold

Water stains on walls or ceilings, or the presence of mold, indicate a leak that needs immediate attention to prevent further damage to your home.

## When in Doubt, Call a Pro
