Water damage doesn't wait for business hours. Whether it's 2 AM on a Sunday or during your kid's birthday party, when water starts pooling on your floor, you need to act fast.

We're Jaime and Hamed, the owners of iFIXX. We've helped hundreds of Charlotte homeowners through water emergencies — burst pipes, overflowing washing machines, storm damage, you name it. This guide is everything we wish someone had told us the first time we faced a flooded basement.

**The bottom line:** The first 24 hours determine whether you're looking at a cleanup or a catastrophe. Let's make sure you handle it right.

## The First 10 Minutes: Stop the Source

Before you grab towels, before you call anyone — **stop the water**.

### If it's a burst or leaking pipe:
1. **Find your main water shutoff valve.** In most Charlotte homes, it's in the basement, crawl space, or near the water heater. It's a wheel valve or lever handle.
2. **Turn it off completely.** Righty-tighty. No water pressure = no more flooding.
3. **Open a faucet on the lowest floor** to drain remaining water from the pipes.

### If it's an appliance (washing machine, dishwasher, water heater):
1. **Unplug the appliance** if you can reach the outlet safely without stepping in water.
2. **Turn off the dedicated water supply valve** behind or beneath the appliance.
3. **If you can't find it, turn off the main water supply.**

### If it's from outside (storm, roof leak):
1. **Place buckets or containers** to catch active drips.
2. **Cover furniture and valuables** with plastic sheeting.
3. **If safe, access your attic** to identify the source.

> ⚠️ **Safety first:** If water is near electrical outlets, your breaker panel, or standing more than an inch deep — **turn off electricity at the main breaker** before doing anything else. Water + electricity = serious danger.

## The First Hour: Damage Control

Once the water source is stopped, your job is preventing further damage.

### Document everything
Before you clean up anything:
- **Take photos and videos** of all affected areas
- **Capture serial numbers** of damaged appliances
- **Note the water level** at its highest point
- **Screenshot the time and date** on your phone

Your insurance company will need all of this. Trust us — you don't want to explain damage that's already been cleaned up.

### Start water removal
Every minute water sits, it's soaking deeper into:
- Drywall (wicks up like a sponge)
- Subflooring (warps and swells)
- Carpet padding (holds water like a reservoir)
- Wood trim and cabinets (permanent damage starts fast)

**What you can do:**
- Use a wet/dry shop vac if you have one
- Mop and bucket for smaller amounts
- Push water toward drains or outside
- Pull up area rugs and lay them flat to dry elsewhere

**What helps air circulation:**
- Open windows if weather permits
- Turn on ceiling fans
- Run your HVAC fan (set to "on" not "auto")
- Position box fans to create airflow across wet surfaces

### Remove what you can save
Get these items out of the water immediately:
- Electronics (TVs, computers, gaming systems)
- Important documents and photos
- Clothing and fabric items
- Furniture legs (put aluminum foil under them to prevent staining)

## Hours 1-8: The Critical Window

This is when mold decides whether your home becomes its new home.

**Mold can start growing in as little as 24-48 hours** in warm, humid conditions — exactly what you have after water damage. Charlotte's humidity makes this timeline even shorter in summer months.

### Professional help becomes essential
Here's the honest truth: beyond surface water removal, this work requires:
- **Industrial dehumidifiers** (not the kind from Home Depot)
- **Commercial air movers** to force dry structural materials
- **Moisture meters** to verify walls and subfloors are actually dry
- **Anti-microbial treatments** to prevent mold growth

You can rent some of this equipment, but knowing where to focus it — and how long to run it — requires experience. We've seen homeowners run fans for a week and still have wet subfloors because they didn't know where the water traveled.

### What iFIXX handles in water damage situations

We get calls at all hours for water emergencies. Here's what we typically handle:

- ✅ **Same-day response** — We answer our phones directly, no call centers
- ✅ **Water extraction** — Getting standing water out fast  
- ✅ **Damaged material removal** — Wet drywall, ruined insulation, soaked carpet
- ✅ **Structural drying coordination** — Working with restoration equipment
- ✅ **Repairs after drying** — Drywall, painting, flooring, trim work
- ✅ **Fixture replacement** — Faucets, toilets, and other items damaged by the incident

We're not a restoration company with franchise fees built into our pricing. We're two guys who know home repair inside and out, and we'll tell you honestly what you need — and what you don't.

## Hours 8-24: Assessment and Planning

Once the immediate emergency is controlled, it's time to understand what you're dealing with.

### Insurance notification
**Call your insurance company within 24 hours.** Most policies require prompt notification for water damage claims.

Have ready:
- Your policy number
- Photos and videos you documented
- Description of what happened
- List of damaged items (be thorough)

> **Pro tip:** Ask specifically about coverage for "remediation" vs. "restoration." Some policies cover drying out the structure but not the repairs afterward. Know what you're working with before you start spending money.

### Assess what's salvageable

**Usually saveable:**
- Solid wood furniture (if caught quickly)
- Hard surface flooring (tile, vinyl plank)
- Metal items
- Glass and ceramics

**Often not saveable:**
- Carpet padding (almost always needs replacement)
- Particleboard furniture
- Upholstered items submerged for more than a few hours
- Drywall that stayed wet too long

**Depends on exposure time:**
- Carpet (surface water = usually fine; soaked for hours = replace)
- Hardwood floors (minor water = can be dried; significant = may cup or buckle)
- Drywall (wet bottom edge = cut and replace; fully soaked = full replacement)

## Common Charlotte Water Damage Scenarios

Living in the Charlotte area, we see certain water damage situations more than others:

### Winter: Frozen and burst pipes
Charlotte gets just cold enough for pipes to freeze — especially in crawl spaces, exterior walls, and unheated garages. When temperatures drop below 20°F, pipes in vulnerable areas can freeze and burst.

**Prevention:** Insulate exposed pipes, keep garage doors closed, let faucets drip during extreme cold.

### Spring/Summer: Storm and roof leaks
Heavy rain events overwhelm gutters, and that water finds its way inside through any weakness in your roof or flashing.

**Prevention:** Clean gutters twice a year, inspect roof after major storms, address missing shingles immediately.

### Year-round: Appliance failures
Water heaters last 8-12 years. Washing machine hoses last 3-5. Dishwasher connections work until they don't. These fail without warning.

**Prevention:** Replace washing machine hoses with braided stainless steel. Know your water heater's age. Inspect under-sink connections annually.

## What to Expect Cost-Wise

We believe in honest pricing, so here's a realistic range for Charlotte water damage situations:

| Scenario | Typical Range |
|----------|---------------|
| Minor leak, quick response, limited area | $500 - $1,500 |
| Moderate water damage, one room | $1,500 - $4,000 |
| Significant damage, multiple rooms | $4,000 - $10,000+ |
| Major flooding, structural involvement | $10,000+ |

These numbers include cleanup, drying, and repairs. Insurance often covers a significant portion — another reason to document everything and file promptly.
