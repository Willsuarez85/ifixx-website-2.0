The internet is full of DIY tutorials that make every home improvement project look easy. But while some projects are great for weekend warriors, others are best left to the pros.

## Safe to DIY

**Painting walls** - With proper prep and good tape, most homeowners can handle interior painting. Just be careful on high ladders.

**Simple caulking** - Resealing around tubs and sinks is a straightforward job with the right caulk.

**Changing fixtures** - Swapping out light fixtures, faucets, and hardware is usually DIY-friendly.

## Call a Professional

**Electrical work** - Anything beyond changing a light bulb or outlet cover should be done by a professional electrician for safety.

**Plumbing behind walls** - A dripping faucet is one thing, but anything involving pipes in walls needs professional skills and tools.

**Structural changes** - Never remove walls or make structural modifications without a professional assessment.

**Anything with permits** - If the job requires permits, you typically need a qualified contractor.

## The Hidden Costs of DIY Gone Wrong

What seems like a money-saving DIY project can quickly become expensive if something goes wrong. Water damage from a plumbing mistake, electrical fires from improper wiring, or simply having to redo poor work all cost more than hiring a pro in the first place.
