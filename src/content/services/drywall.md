faqs:
  - q: "How long does drywall repair take?"
    a: "Small repairs (< 6 inches) take 2-4 hours same-day. Medium repairs (6-24 inches) take 1-2 days for drying time between coats. Large repairs or full section replacement take 2-3 days including demo, installation, multiple coats, texture, and paint."
  - q: "Can you match my ceiling texture perfectly?"
    a: "Yes. Texture matching is our specialty. We've done hundreds of repairs across Charlotte—every texture type, every era of home. We bring samples, test on scrap material, and dial in the exact pattern before applying it to your ceiling. Common textures we match: orange peel (most common in Charlotte), knockdown, skip trowel, smooth finish, and popcorn (acoustic ceiling)."
  - q: "Do you paint after repair?"
    a: "Yes. Drywall repair without paint is an unfinished job. We always prime the repair (required for proper paint adhesion). Then we can spot paint just the repaired area if you have matching paint, paint the entire wall or ceiling for uniform color, or do full room painting if your paint is aged or faded. We'll recommend what looks best."
  - q: "Is same-day service available?"
    a: "For urgent repairs, yes. If you have water damage (active leak stopped but drywall soaked), a security issue (hole exposing exterior), or an emergency situation, call (980) 391-6833 before noon and we'll prioritize same-day service when possible. For non-emergency repairs, we typically schedule within 2-3 days."
  - q: "How do I know if I need repair or full replacement?"
    a: "Repair (patching) works for small to medium holes (< 12 inches), isolated cracks, and surface damage with solid backing. Replacement (full section) is needed for water-damaged drywall (soft, warped, or mold present), large holes or extensive damage (> 12 inches), compromised structural integrity, or damage affecting multiple studs or ceiling joists. We'll assess for free and be honest about what you need."
  - q: "What affects the price of drywall repair?"
    a: "Price depends on size of damage, number of repairs (multiple small repairs in one room can often batch for slight discount), texture complexity (smooth finish or custom texture takes longer than standard orange peel), whether paint is included (spot painting vs. full wall), and accessibility (high ceilings, cathedral ceilings, or tight spaces require additional time and equipment)."
  - q: "Can you fix water-damaged drywall?"
    a: "Yes, but only AFTER the water source is fixed. We cut out the damaged section (water-damaged drywall is compromised and likely holds mold), dry the cavity completely, install fresh material, tape, texture, and prime. If there's visible mold or a musty smell, we remove the affected drywall completely. For major mold issues, you may need a remediation specialist first."

## Common Drywall Issues We Fix

Drywall damage happens. Accidents, settling, water leaks, wear and tear. Here's what we see most often in Charlotte homes.

### Holes and Cracks

**Small holes (nail/screw holes):**  
Left behind from picture frames, shelves, or TVs. Quick to patch, but need proper filling and sanding to disappear completely.

**Medium holes (doorknob, accidental impact):**  
The classic doorknob-through-the-wall. Or moving furniture that got too close. These need backing support, not just spackle.

**Large holes (furniture, impact damage):**  
Bigger damage from furniture, kids, or accidents. Requires cutting out the damaged section, installing backing, and patching with new drywall.

**Cracks (settling, foundation movement):**  
Common in Charlotte's older brick homes. Foundation settling creates stress cracks, especially around doors and windows. If your home was built in the 1950s-70s in Myers Park, Dilworth, or Plaza Midwood, you've probably seen these. We repair the crack and reinforce with mesh tape to prevent it from reopening.

### Water Damage

Charlotte's humidity doesn't mess around. Water damage spreads fast here.

**Ceiling stains from leaks:**  
That brown spot on your ceiling? It's from a roof leak, upstairs plumbing, or AC condensation. Even if the leak is fixed, the stained drywall needs replacement—it's compromised and likely holds mold.

**Warped or soft drywall:**  
If you press on the drywall and it feels soft or spongy, the water has soaked through. It won't dry properly. That section needs to be cut out and replaced.

**Mold potential (Charlotte's 80%+ summer humidity):**  
Water damage + Charlotte humidity = mold growth in 24-48 hours. If there's visible mold or a musty smell, we remove the affected drywall completely, dry the cavity, and install fresh material.

**Complete section replacement:**  
Sometimes a small leak damages a large area. We don't just patch around it—we replace the entire section for structural integrity and a clean finish.

> **Related service:** Fixing the leak? See our [water damage repair service](/emergency-services/water-damage/).

### Texture Matching

**This is where most DIY repairs fail.** You can fill a hole. But making the repair invisible? That's art + experience.

**Orange peel texture:**  
The most common in Charlotte homes. Looks like the surface of an orange. Requires a sprayer and the right viscosity mix to replicate perfectly.

**Knockdown texture:**  
Popular in newer Charlotte homes. The texture is sprayed, then lightly "knocked down" with a trowel. Timing and technique matter—too early or too late and it won't match.

**Smooth finish:**  
Common in older homes and high-end remodels. No texture, just perfectly smooth. Requires multiple coats of joint compound, sanding between each, and a steady hand.

**The challenge:**  
Walk into any Home Depot and ask for "texture spray." They'll sell it to you. But matching your home's exact texture—the pattern, the depth, the consistency—that's not DIY territory. **We bring samples, test on scrap, and dial it in before touching your wall.**

### Other Common Issues

**Nail pops:**  
Nails backing out over time, creating small bumps. Common as houses settle. We reset the nail, add a screw nearby for support, fill, sand, and paint.

**Corner bead damage:**  
The metal corner protectors on outside corners get dinged by vacuum cleaners, furniture, kids. We replace the damaged section and blend it seamlessly.

**Tape separation:**  
The tape between drywall sheets pulls away, creating visible seams or cracks. We re-tape with mesh or paper tape (depending on the area), apply fresh joint compound, and refinish.

**Poor previous repairs:**  
We see a lot of "my husband tried to fix it" patches. No judgment—drywall is harder than it looks. We redo it properly so it actually disappears.

## Drywall Repair Pricing (Transparent)

We believe in upfront pricing. Here's what drywall repair typically costs in Charlotte.

### Standard Pricing Ranges

**Small repairs (< 6 inches):** $100-$200  
- Nail pops, small holes, minor cracks
- Includes patching, sanding, priming
- Paint touch-up (if we have matching paint)

**Medium repairs (6"-24"):** $200-$400  
- Doorknob holes, larger cracks, small sections of water damage
- Includes backing, patching, texture matching, priming
- Spot painting or wall painting (quote depends on size)

**Large repairs (24"+):** $400-$800  
- Extensive water damage, large holes, multiple repairs
- Full section replacement, texture matching, priming, painting

**Full wall or ceiling replacement:** $800-$1,500+  
- Severe water damage, complete drywall replacement
- Includes demo, new drywall installation, taping, mudding, texture, prime, paint
- Price depends on room size and accessibility

### What Affects the Price?

**Size of damage:**  
A 2-inch hole costs less than a 2-foot hole. Pretty straightforward.

**Number of repairs:**  
Multiple small repairs in the same room? We can often batch them for efficiency (slight discount).

**Texture complexity:**  
Smooth finish or custom texture takes longer than standard orange peel. More time = higher cost.

**Paint included?**  
Spot painting (just the repair) is less expensive than painting the entire wall or ceiling. We'll recommend what looks best.

**Accessibility:**  
Standard height (8-9 ft ceilings) = standard pricing. High ceilings, cathedral ceilings, or tight crawl spaces = additional time and equipment.

### Free Estimates, Always

**Text photos to (980) 391-6833.** We'll give you a ballpark estimate based on photos. Or we'll come out for a free on-site assessment.

**No hidden fees.** If we open up a repair and discover additional damage (mold, structural issues), we'll explain it and get your approval before proceeding.

## Before/After Examples & Charlotte Context

**See our work:** Check out our project gallery for before-and-after photos of drywall repairs across Charlotte.

### Common Drywall Issues in Charlotte Homes

**Charlotte's brick homes and settling cracks:**  
Brick homes are beautiful and common in Charlotte. But brick is rigid—when the foundation settles (and it will over time), the brick can't flex. The stress transfers to interior drywall, creating cracks around doors, windows, and corners. **We see this constantly in Myers Park, Dilworth, and Eastover homes built in the 1950s-70s.**

**Older homes (1950s-70s) and plaster-over-lath:**  
Some older Charlotte homes have plaster walls, not drywall. If your home has plaster, repairs are different (and we handle those too). But many 1960s-70s homes were the transition era—plaster in some rooms, drywall in others. We work with both.

**Storm damage and roof leaks:**  
Charlotte's storm season (May-September) brings sudden downpours. Roof leaks often don't show up until the second or third storm. By then, ceiling drywall is stained and needs replacement. **If you've had a leak, check your ceilings. Brown stains mean water damage.**

**Water damage from humidity and AC condensation:**  
Charlotte summers = 80%+ humidity + heavy AC use. AC condensation leaks are common, especially in older homes with original HVAC systems. We fix the drywall; you fix the AC.
