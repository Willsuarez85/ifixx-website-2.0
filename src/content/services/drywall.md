faqs:
  - q: "How much does drywall repair cost in Charlotte?"
    a: "Small holes (fist-size or smaller): $75-150. Medium repairs: $150-300. Large sections or water damage: $300-600+. We always quote before starting."
  - q: "Can you match my wall texture?"
    a: "Yes. We match orange peel, knockdown, smooth, and most common textures. We bring samples and test before applying to make sure it blends."
  - q: "Do you paint after the repair?"
    a: "We prime the repair so it's ready for paint. We can paint the whole wall for an additional charge, or you can paint it yourself — primer makes it easy."
  - q: "How long does drywall repair take?"
    a: "Most repairs take 1-3 hours. Large sections might need two visits — one for patching/taping, one for finishing after it dries."
  - q: "Can you fix water-damaged drywall?"
    a: "Yes, but only AFTER the water source is fixed. We cut out the damaged section, replace it, tape, texture, and prime. If there's mold, you may need a remediation specialist first."
  - q: "What about popcorn ceiling repair?"
    a: "We can patch popcorn ceilings, but matching old popcorn texture exactly is difficult. We'll be honest about what's possible before we start."

## Drywall Damage Happens — We Fix It Fast

Doorknob went through the wall? Kids got creative? Water leak left a stain? We've seen it all, and we fix it all.

Drywall repair isn't just about filling a hole — it's about making the wall look like the damage never happened. That means proper patching, tape, mud, and texture matching. We take the time to get it right.

## Common Drywall Problems We Fix

**Holes**
- Doorknob holes (the classic)
- Anchor holes from shelves and TVs
- Accidental damage from moving furniture
- Holes from removed fixtures

**Cracks**
- Settling cracks near doors and windows
- Ceiling cracks
- Corner cracks
- Cracks from temperature changes

**Water Damage**
- Ceiling stains from roof or plumbing leaks
- Bubbling or peeling drywall tape
- Soft or sagging drywall sections
- Discoloration from moisture

**Wear and Tear**
- Nail pops (those circles that appear over time)
- Dented corner beads
- Scuffed or gouged walls
- Peeling joint tape

## Our Texture Matching Process

The hardest part of drywall repair is matching the existing texture. Here's how we do it:

1. **Identify the texture** — Orange peel? Knockdown? Skip trowel? Smooth?
2. **Test on cardboard** — We spray/apply a sample to match before touching your wall
3. **Apply to the repair** — Once we have the right texture, we apply it
4. **Feather the edges** — Blend into the surrounding area so there's no visible line
5. **Prime** — Seal it so paint adheres evenly

## What We Don't Do

We're honest about our limits:

- **Mold remediation** — If there's active mold behind the drywall, you need a specialist first
- **Structural repairs** — If the wall framing is damaged, that's a bigger job
- **Asbestos** — Older homes (pre-1980) might have asbestos in texture; we don't disturb that

Not sure if your job falls in our wheelhouse? Text us photos and we'll tell you straight.

## Why Hire Us vs. DIY?

You CAN patch drywall yourself. But:

- **Texture matching is hard** — Most DIY repairs are obvious because the texture doesn't match
- **Multiple coats and sanding** — It takes 2-3 coats with drying time between. We do this all day.
- **Tools and materials** — By the time you buy everything, you could have hired us

For small nail holes, sure, DIY it. For anything bigger than a baseball? Call us.

## Same-Day Service Available

Most drywall repairs can be done same-day. Call or text (980) 391-6833 — send us a photo and we'll give you a quote within minutes.
