Your shower or tub is the centerpiece of your bathroom. We install a full range of options to fit your needs:

**Walk-in Showers**
- Frameless glass enclosures for a modern, open look
- Custom tile surrounds with accent strips
- Built-in niches and benches
- Rain showerheads and body sprays
- Barrier-free (curbless) designs for accessibility

One of our most popular services. We remove your old tub and create a spacious walk-in shower. Perfect for homeowners who rarely use their tub and want more shower space.

**Bathtub Installation**
- Alcove tubs (standard size, budget-friendly)
- Freestanding soaking tubs (statement pieces)
