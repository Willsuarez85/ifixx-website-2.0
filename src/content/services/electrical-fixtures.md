faqs:
  - q: "Do I need an electrician for a broken outlet?"
    a: "Not usually. If you're just replacing an existing outlet or switch in the same location, that's a simple swap we can handle as handymen. No electrician needed."
  - q: "Can you install a ceiling fan where I already have a light?"
    a: "Yes! If there's already an electrical box in the ceiling for a light fixture, we can swap it for a ceiling fan. If there's no existing wiring, you'd need an electrician to run new wire."
  - q: "What electrical work CAN'T you do?"
    a: "We don't do panel work, run new wiring in walls, or add new circuits. For that, you need a licensed electrician. We're happy to refer you if needed."
  - q: "How much does outlet replacement cost?"
    a: "Simple outlet or switch replacement is typically $50-100. Ceiling fan installation runs $100-200 depending on the fan and setup."

## What Needs a Licensed Electrician

We're honest about our limits. For these jobs, you'll need a licensed electrician:

- Any work requiring permits

**Not sure?** Text us a photo and we'll tell you honestly if we can help or if you need a specialist.

## Why Call Us Instead of an Electrician?

**Faster** — Electricians are often booked days out. We can usually come same-day.
