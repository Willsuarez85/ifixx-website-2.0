## Our Painting Services

We handle all types of residential painting projects in Charlotte. Here's what we offer:

### Interior Painting

**Walls & Ceilings:**
Fresh paint transforms a room instantly. We prep surfaces properly, apply 2-3 coats of premium paint, and deliver a smooth, professional finish. Whether you're going neutral or bold, we help you choose colors that work.

**Trim & Baseboards:**
Detailed brushwork on all trim, baseboards, crown molding, and door frames. Crisp lines, no drips, professional results.

**Cabinets:**
Kitchen and bathroom cabinet painting is one of the most cost-effective upgrades. We clean, sand, prime, and apply durable cabinet paint that stands up to daily use. Transforms your kitchen for a fraction of a remodel cost.

**Doors:**
Interior and exterior doors. We remove hardware, prep properly, and apply smooth coats for a factory-like finish.

**Accent Walls:**
Bold color on one wall creates visual interest. We help you choose the right wall and color for maximum impact.

**Color Consultation:**
Overwhelmed by paint swatches? We help you narrow down choices based on lighting, room size, and your style. Free consultation included.

### Exterior Painting

**Siding:**
Vinyl, wood, fiber cement, or brick—we handle all siding types. Proper surface prep, quality exterior paint, and weather-resistant finishes that protect your home.

**Trim & Shutters:**
Exterior trim and shutters take the most abuse from weather. We prep, prime, and paint for long-lasting protection and curb appeal.

**Decks & Fences:**
Wood decks and fences need regular staining or painting to prevent rot and weathering. We clean, repair damaged boards, and apply quality stain or paint for protection and beauty.

**Doors & Garage Doors:**
Front doors and garage doors are focal points. Fresh paint or stain makes a dramatic difference in curb appeal.

### Specialty Services

**Popcorn Ceiling Removal:**
That outdated popcorn texture? We scrape it off, repair the ceiling, texture to match (or go smooth), and paint. Modernizes your home instantly.

**Texture Matching:**
After drywall repairs, texture matching is critical. We match orange peel, knockdown, skip trowel, and other common textures so repairs disappear.

> **Related service:** Need drywall repair first? See our [drywall repair services](/repairs/drywall/).

**Wallpaper Removal:**
Old wallpaper? We remove it properly, repair the wall surface, and paint fresh.

## The iFIXX Painting Process

We follow a proven process that delivers professional results every time.

### Step 1: Free Color Consultation

**Not sure what colors to choose?** We help. We discuss your vision, consider lighting and room size, recommend color palettes, and provide paint samples if needed.

**We'll be honest:** Some colors look great on a tiny swatch but terrible on four walls. We guide you toward choices that work in your space.

### Step 2: Surface Preparation (The Critical Step)

**This is where most DIY painting fails.** Great paint over bad prep = bad results.

**Our prep process:**
- **Clean surfaces** — Remove dust, grease, and grime
- **Fill holes and cracks** — Spackle nail holes, fill larger damage
- **Sand smooth** — Smooth out patches and glossy surfaces
- **Caulk gaps** — Seal gaps between trim and walls
- **Protect everything** — Drop cloths on floors, plastic over furniture
- **Tape edges** — Clean lines on trim and ceilings
- **Prime when needed** — New drywall, stains, color changes, or bare wood

**Why this matters:** Paint doesn't hide imperfections—it highlights them. Proper prep creates a smooth canvas for flawless results.

### Step 3: Professional Paint Application

**We apply 2-3 coats** (depending on color change and coverage). Each coat is applied with proper technique and allowed to dry completely before the next.

**Interior walls & ceilings:**
- Brush-cut edges and corners
- Roller application with proper nap for your texture
- Even coverage, no roller marks or streaks
- Adequate dry time between coats

**Trim & detail work:**
- Detailed brushwork for crisp lines
- No drips, sags, or visible brush marks
- Smooth, factory-like finish

**What paint we use:**
Primarily Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore—professional-grade paints with better coverage, durability, and color retention than big-box store brands. We can also work with your preferred brand if you have one.

### Step 4: Final Walkthrough & Cleanup

**Before we leave:**
- Walk through every room with you
- Inspect for any missed spots or imperfections
- Touch up as needed
- Remove all tape and protection
- Vacuum and wipe down surfaces
- Haul away all debris

**Your space will be cleaner than when we arrived.** We respect your home.

## Before/After Examples & Charlotte Context

**See our work:** Check out our project gallery for before-and-after photos of painting projects across Charlotte.

### Common Painting Needs in Charlotte Homes

**Charlotte's humidity and exterior paint:**
Charlotte summers = high humidity + intense sun. Exterior paint takes a beating. We see fading, peeling, and mildew growth on north-facing walls. Quality exterior paint + proper prep = longer-lasting protection.

**Older homes (1950s-70s) and dark wood trim:**
Many Charlotte homes in Myers Park, Dilworth, and Plaza Midwood have dark stained wood trim. Painting it white or lighter colors modernizes the space dramatically. We prep wood trim properly for paint adhesion.

**Popcorn ceilings in 1980s-90s homes:**
Popcorn texture was everywhere in the 80s and 90s. Removing it and going smooth (or knockdown texture) updates your home instantly. We see this request constantly in South Charlotte and Ballantyne.

**Cabinet painting vs. full kitchen remodel:**
A full kitchen remodel in Charlotte costs $25,000-50,000+. Cabinet painting costs $1,500-3,000 and transforms the space. It's the #1 ROI upgrade for kitchens. We see this in homes preparing to sell.

## Painting FAQs

### How long does a painting project take?

**Single room:** 1-2 days (including prep and dry time)

**Multiple rooms:** 2-4 days

**Full interior (2,000 sq ft):** 3-5 days

**Exterior:** 3-7 days (weather-dependent)

**Cabinet painting:** 3-5 days (drying time between coats is critical)

### Do you work on weekends?

Yes, we can schedule weekend work for an additional fee. Many homeowners prefer us to paint while they're away.

### What if I don't like the color after it's on the wall?

We provide samples and recommend testing colors before committing. But if you change your mind, we can repaint. You'll cover the cost of new paint; we'll discount our labor.

### Can you paint in winter?

**Interior painting:** Yes, year-round. We just need heat in the space.

**Exterior painting:** Only when temps are above 50°F and no rain in the forecast. Cold paint doesn't cure properly.

### Do I need to be home during painting?

Not required, but many homeowners prefer to be home (at least initially). We're respectful, professional, and trustworthy. Background checks on file.
