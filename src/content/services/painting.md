## What We Repair

## Our Drywall Repair Process

**1. Assess the Damage**
We look at the size, location, and cause. If there's water damage, we make sure the leak is fixed first.

**2. Cut & Patch**
We cut out the damaged section cleanly, install a patch or new drywall piece, and tape the seams.

**3. Mud & Sand**
We apply joint compound, let it dry, and sand smooth. Multiple coats for a seamless finish.

**4. Texture Match**
We match your existing wall texture. This is where experience matters — bad texture matching is obvious.

**5. Prime & Paint**
We prime the repair and paint to match your wall. Done right, you can't tell there was ever damage.
